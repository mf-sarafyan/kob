# Money

Terminando o episódio **Keepers of the Stars** - depois de resgatar a Betsy - a party tinha 2'000gp. Isso é antes do downtime enquanto a Betsy é consertada. 

Vamos usar a nota [[kob/content/1 Keepers' Compendium/wiki/entry/Calendar & Downtime Turns|Calendar & Downtime Turns]] pra acompanhar os dinheiros daqui pra frente. 


# Items

### [[Baang]]
*Blacksteel Razor*. Blacksteel is dark, silent, and nonreflective. It makes no noise when striking other objects or creatures (even if it is broken or shattered). Blood clings to the razor, rather than spraying or dripping. +1 Dagger. 
*Krysknife.* Made from what appears to be the tooth of a giant worm that lived inside an infinitely large maw, halfway through a portal to the Abyss. +1 Shortsword. 
*[[Whisttle]].* 
[[Blipware TM Hookshot]]
[[Blipware TM Jammer Hammer]]


### [[Bad Juju]]
*Pearl of Power.* While this pearl is on your person, you can use an action to speak its command word and regain one expended spell slot. If the expended slot was of 4th level or higher, the new slot is 3rd level. Once you have used the pearl, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
*[[Anarchic Amplifier]]*. 
[[Blipware TM Hookshot]].
[[Blipware TM Jammer Hammer]].


### [[Gizmo]]
*Flannis' Diary.* With this in your possession and Alchemist's Tools, you can extract Corposedamp Gas through a gruesome process. If you have a humanoid corpse and these tools, you can work during a short rest (you still benefit from the rest) to destroy the corpse and create one vial of gas. 
	*Corpsedamp Gas.* Throw at a 10ft cube within 20ft. Creatures in the cube must make a DC 15 Dex save or take 2d8 force damage (half on success). 
*Wand of Magic Missles*. This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the [_magic missile_](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:magic%20missile?expansion=34047#content) spell from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 1st-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend. The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
*KABOOMER Blueprint*. You can build a [[KABOOMER]] during downtime; it costs one turn and 100GP.
