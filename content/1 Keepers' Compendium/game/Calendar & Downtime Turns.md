*As datas fazem mais sentido se ler as notas no relates-to.*

> Estamos em 574 CY em Greyhawk, e 1494 DR em Faerûn. Isso coloca a gente 5 anos depois da [[Battle of the Emridy Meadows]] em Oerth, pra história do Baang fazer sentido, e no ano de Descent into Avernus, que estava acontecendo no nosso capítulo 1. Baldur's Gate 3 deve acontecer daqui a uns 2 anos in-game.
> Funny enough, o material oficial diz que DiA é em 94 e BG3 em 92, sendo que BG3 referencia coisas que acontecem em DiA e em outra aventura que também é em 94, o que significa que, surpreendentemente, todos esses números são inventados e não querem dizer nada.

# Chapter 1: Keepers of the Gate, or The Keeper of Whispers
Elturel falls into Avernus somewhere in 1494 DR, which should be around Ready'reat 573 CY - our intro is us "getting ready".

## At the Academy
*Let's say the graduation took about six months...*
We start the graduation around New Year's 574 in Oerth. 
Our Keepers arrive in Bral in the middle of Wealsun.

## Rescuing Betsy 
*In the second week of Reaping, an Abyssal confluence brought the Material close enough for a portal to open - right when [[kbβ41]] were investigating... Right after, the player characters are [[Finding Betsy]].*

You were left with a loose end - who got Ariel Palavro's (the forger) mind wiped? You need access to the Obliviattos Archives to figure that out. This will cost you a Cash-in from a Friendly faction! *(See [[Faction Relations]])*
