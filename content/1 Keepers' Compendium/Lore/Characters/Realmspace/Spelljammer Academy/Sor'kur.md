Thri-kreen Receptionist

The thri-kreen receptionist Sor’kur (pronounced SOAR-ker) is always busy, and there’s no one better suited for the job. Whether she’s sorting mail, passing messages, asking requests for assistance via several [sending stones](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5402-sending-stones), or handing out welcome packs to new recruits, her multiple arms make it all look easy. Sor’kur has white chitin mottled with patches of brilliant blue, and matching blue eyes.
