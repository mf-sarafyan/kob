**Anadia**

The surface of Anadia is an expanse of badlands and dry washes except at its poles, where the land flattens out into gently rolling, fertile hills dotted with forests and patches of grassland. Communities of halflings occupy the polar areas, while the barren wastes are populated by monstrous predators and scavengers.

**Coliar**

This gas giant has a multitude of earth and water islands swirling around in its turbulent winds. These islands are occupied mostly by aarakocra, lizardfolk, and dragons. The lizardfolk, in particular, are accustomed to trading with spacefaring folk.

**Toril**

Toril, the locale of the Forgotten Realms setting, is the most populous world in Realmspace and home to some of the most powerful individuals in this system. It has regular and prosperous ties with the various nations and factions of Wildspace.

Toril’s single large moon, Selune, has a breathable atmosphere and is occupied by isolated groups of inhabitants. Toril’s space-dwelling communities generally congregate in a cluster of asteroids that trails behind Selune in the same orbit. This cluster, called the Tears of Selune, has numerous settlements. The Rock of Bral (described in the Astral Adventurer’s Guide) could be one of the many asteroids that form the cluster.

**Karpri**

This water world has icecaps at its poles and vegetation-choked waters in its equatorial region. In between, on either side of the equatorial zone, are bands of featureless ocean—nothing but water as far as the eye can see. Most of the planet’s indigenous creatures are aquatic and dwell in the tropical sargasso, since the planet has no land masses that can support life.

**Chandos**

Chandos is a large water world with thousands of floating islands that often collide with one another, making these locations less than ideal for permanent settlements. Beneath the islands, in the depths of Chandos, live all sorts of bioluminescent aquatic creatures.

**Glyth**

Spelljamming ships known as nautiloids (described in the Astral Adventurer’s Guide) patrol the space within 100 million miles of Glyth and hide behind the planet’s three moons. This is not surprising because mind flayers are the undisputed masters of Glyth. The planet’s air smells like it came from a charnel house, but it is not poisonous. The surface of the planet is a desolate wasteland, but beneath the crust is a labyrinth of subterranean caves inhabited by mind flayer colonies.

**Garden**

Garden is a cluster of seven planetoids inside a common air envelope, each of them linked to the others by the roots of an unimaginably large plant sometimes referred to as Yggdrasil’s Child. Wildspace travelers sometimes come to Garden to restock their food, water, and air.

Garden is a refuge for spacefaring pirates, who hide their spelljamming ships in the maze of passageways that run between Yggdrasil’s Child and the planetoids, and might do the same in the craters and canyons on any of Garden’s eleven moons.

**H’catha**

H’catha is a disk of water floating in space, with a single large mountain called the Spindle jutting from its center. The water disk tapers at the edge to form a rim. The Spindle is 200 miles across at its base, and tapers to a peak 1,000 miles above the surface of the water. The caverns inside the Spindle are home to five warring subspecies of beholders.
