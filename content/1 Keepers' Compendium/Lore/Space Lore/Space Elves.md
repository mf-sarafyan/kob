# Singers and Dreamers
This is not a lore that is written. This is a lore whispered in the rustling of leaves. A lore sung by the wind. This is a lore dreamt. 

Before everything, the Sun was One. 
Then there was a Breath, and the Sun was Divided. 
And soon the Breath was a Song. And Breath's life spread through the stars, and the Song followed. And the creatures would listen and dream of the song, until one started to sing. They were the first elf. 

And more followed! Their joy was to live and listen and sing with the Song. And when they died, in their dreams, they became part of the Song - to be sung again, in another place, in another time. And in their dreams, the singers too saw, lived, sung, their past lives. 

Now the stars are old, and the Song is but a whisper. And the Elves are born and reborn, and they search for it, they long for it to be as they remember it in their dreams. Some are happy to long. Some say - if the Song pauses, it will come back stronger. If the Sun was One, it will begin again. 

Under lesser suns, flesh and bone elves will dream, and sing, and remember. They will sing with the sky and the trees, and be at peace. 

In the emptiness of the Astral, the Dreamers remember. Their sky is black and their trees are wooden hulls, and theirs is a song of war.
