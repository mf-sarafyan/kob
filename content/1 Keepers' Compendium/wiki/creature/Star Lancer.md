## Overview

## Description
Star lancers are large, celestial beings that resemble sharks with four wings and a long tail. They are thought to be reincarnations of devoted worshipers from a dead god, found in the Astral Sea among the remains of colossal deities.

## Behavior
These creatures communicate via telepathy and can turn themselves and their riders invisible, making them excellent for stealth missions. The githyanki often use star lancers as mounts, flying in flocks across the Astral Sea.

## Ecology
Star lancers inhabit the Great Cavern within the remains of a dead god, where their souls are reborn after death. Their population remains finite as long as the god's remains and the cavern are intact.

## History
The githyanki stumbled upon star lancers while exploring the insides of a dead god, leading to a unique alliance between the two. This relationship highlights the intertwining lives of the githyanki and the star lancers in the mystical realms of the multiverse.
