## Overview

## Description
Horg are winged humanoid-like creatures standing about 7-feet tall with membranous wings measuring 12-feet in span. They have seven yellow-white eyes arranged in a ring on a bulbous head and a tooth-filled mouth that opens like a camera iris.

## Behavior
Highly aggressive, horg attack without warning and are known to prey on all spacefaring races. They are disliked particularly by the neogi, who harbor a strong hatred for them.

## Combat
Horgs are born warriors, using their claws and teeth to attack, supported by corrosive, poisonous fluid they secrete. They can phase in and out of the Material plane, which they use to ambush opponents and evade capture.

## Society
Little is known about horg society, as they have not been observed outside of their attacks. They do not seem to use tools or weapons and sex differentiation remains a mystery, as no immature horg have ever been recorded.

## Locations

- The Grinder
- Greyspace
