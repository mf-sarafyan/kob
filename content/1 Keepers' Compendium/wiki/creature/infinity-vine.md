## Overview

## Description

An infinity vine is a solitary, leafless plant characterized by its bright green color and thin, interwoven stems, adorned with numerous bright blue flowers. It thrives in wildspace, rapidly growing as long as it has access to breathable air and light.

## Behavior

Considered an environmental hazard by most spelljamming crews, the infinity vine can grow uncontrollably on celestial bodies, potentially increasing the tonnage of ships by up to four times. While it is harmless to living beings, it can entangle and bury slow-moving creatures and can only be cleared through fire or magical means.

## Ecology

This plant does not grow on planetary bodies over 100 miles in diameter and shrivels in the presence of phlogiston. When taken back into wildspace with air and light, it can revive and regrow.

## Uses

Infinity vine has practical uses for elves, particularly in creating safe havens on asteroids during sieges. It provides air and food, allowing for the establishment of settlements that can utilize the vine for protection and sustenance.
