## Overview

## Description
Meteorspawn are enormous creatures resembling asteroids, ranging in color from black to earth brown to slate gray. They are typically over 100 feet in diameter, with some specimens rumored to be much larger. Their anatomy includes a large mouth for suction and two waste orifices.

## Behavior
Despite their size, meteorspawn have no interest in consuming spelljamming vessels; they primarily drift through space, feeding on rocks and minerals. They eject waste material in the form of high-speed meteors, creating additional hazards in their vicinity.

## Ecology
Meteorspawn are solitary creatures thriving in wildspace, where they help clear navigational hazards by consuming loose rocks. They gestate young during their long lifespans of several centuries, and the birth of a meteorspawn is seen by some spacefarers as a sign of good fortune.

## Combat
Meteorspawn are thick-skinned and do not react to attacks until they have sustained significant damage. Their primary means of attack is to launch meteors from their waste orifices at high speed, causing considerable damage to those in their path.

## Habitat
These creatures inhabit the vastness of wildspace, often pulling in atmosphere from nearby planets while serving as a source of meteors for spacefarers. They play a unique role in balancing the ecology of their environment by reducing the overall volume of rocky materials.
