## Overview

## Description
Greatswans are massive, beautiful birds with long necks and snow-white plumage, averaging 10 feet in length and with a wingspan of 28 feet. Males are referred to as 'cobs,' females as 'pens,' and young as 'cygnets.'

## Behavior
Though generally gentle, greatswans are known to be ferocious fighters with a quick temper. They can fight using their beaks and wings, and can detect intruders, including invisible foes, raising alarms when they do.

## Ecology
Greatswans inhabit sylvan areas and require little air, able to sustain themselves for up to 24 hours. They are herbivores and insectivores, consuming a variety of plants and insects, including poisonous ones.

## Society
Greatswans are exclusively found in elven lands and are regarded as valuable mounts and guards. The elves train these creatures to recognize their commands and monitor their movements closely to maintain ecological balance.

## Swanrider cavalry
Elven cavalry units ride greatswans into battle, typically armed with lances and bows. A greatswan can carry up to two elf-sized riders and serve as effective aerial support during combat.
