## Overview

## Description
A gravislayer's body is a sphere of flesh approximately six feet in diameter, featuring a grayish surface scarred from the rigors of deep space. It has no visible eyes or ears, and only its large mouth becomes apparent when feeding on crushed prey.

## Behavior
Gravislayers are spacefaring predators that manipulate gravity to hunt, often crushing prey with falling objects such as asteroids. They are known to create a gravity source from their victims, causing significant damage due to the momentum of falling objects.

## Ecology
The reproductive methods of gravislayers are unknown, as none have been captured alive. They are immune to the gravity effects they create but not to natural gravity.

## History
Gravislayers lack a known planet of origin or society. According to spacefarer tales, they were allegedly created by a cult of powerful wizards known as nebulords for their own ends.
