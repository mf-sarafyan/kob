## Overview

## Description
Gullions are large gull-like birds standing 3 feet tall. Their plumage can vary widely, showcasing colors from purple and orange to standard white and grey.

## Behavior
As scavengers, gullions are known for their sneaky nature and will even create diversions to steal food. They pose a threat primarily when hungry and in large numbers, attacking crew members for food when desperate.

## Ecology
Gullions thrive in a variety of environments, especially in port cities and aboard spelljamming vessels. Their diet includes rats, garbage, and leftovers, enabling them to be opportunistic feeders.

## History
These creatures are considered pests by spelljamming crews, given their demand for food and resources. Gullions often hitch rides on ships, adapting to life within the air envelope and relying on local port towns for sustenance.
