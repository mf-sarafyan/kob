## Overview

## Description
A q'nidar resembles a gigantic bat with a semi-crystalline hide, appearing similar to a radiant dragon. They possess a unique communication method using thermal breath that is detectable by other q'nidar.

## Behavior
Q'nidar feed on heat and light and are often mistaken for other vapor bats. They are attracted to spelljamming ships due to their lights and activities, but excessive background heat can confuse them.

## Ecology
These creatures travel in packs and adopt a single-line formation to feed on heat trails. They are often found along spaceways and trade lanes in wildspace, and they tend to become crystallized when dying or over-absorbing heat.

## Combat
When interacting with ships, their heat breath can ignite flammable materials. If threatened, they will increase the heat of their breath, causing aggravated fire damage until they are no longer interrupted while feeding.

## Uses
Q'nidar hides are useful for heat- and light-based spells, while their crystallized forms can act like a spelljamming helm or be fashioned into crystal balls.
