## Overview

## Description
The lumineaux is an enormous semi-transparent manta-like creature infused with phlogiston, giving it a rainbow-colored hue that provides excellent camouflage within the Flow. These vast creatures resemble white cells gliding through the lifeblood of the cosmos, filtering out impurities.

## Behavior
Lumineaux primarily seek out portals, wrapping themselves around them and becoming virtually invisible to travelers. They wait for living beings to pass through, using their camouflaging ability to remain undetected until their moment to drain memories.

## Ecology
Lumineaux are rare creatures known to inhabit the Flow, usually encountered alone but sometimes in pairs guarding portals. Their secretive nature and the mystery surrounding their habits make them enigmatic figures in their environment.

## Combat
They feed on memories by establishing a telepathic link with intelligent beings, draining their life experiences temporarily. This memory drain can cause confusion in victims, who may not immediately realize their memories are being lost, while the lumineaux itself does not usually intend to kill its prey.
