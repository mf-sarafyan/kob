## Overview

## Description
A jammer leech resembles a terrestrial barnacle, with a hard shell that can grow to be a foot tall. The shell closely matches the color of the ship it inhabits, making it difficult to spot. Its body resembles that of a snail, is reddish-purple in color, and includes a tentacle with a sharp spike.

## Behavior
Jammer leeches are parasites that attach to spelljamming ships and draw magical energy from the ship's helmsman. They can defend themselves using their spiked tentacles and by discharging absorbed spells at random, making them dangerous if not properly managed.

## Ecology
These leeches do not require air and can thrive on any spelljamming ship. They begin life as spores, attaching themselves to the hull of a ship and feeding off its material. They are usually found in small groups, and while they have few natural predators, they are capable of repelling attackers with their painful defensive strikes.

## Uses
The adhesive produced by jammer leeches is highly prized for its strength and magical resistance, but collecting the leeches is dangerous and challenging, making the adhesive rare and valuable.
