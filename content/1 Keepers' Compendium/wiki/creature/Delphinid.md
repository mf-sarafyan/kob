## Overview

## Description
Delphinids are friendly, dolphin-like creatures that inhabit the phlogiston. Their bodies are fish-shaped with trilateral symmetry, featuring three eyes, three jaws, and three dorsal fins, and they can change their skin color to match the rainbow hues of their environment.

## Behavior
These creatures are playful and social, often engaging sailors and keeping them company. They possess individual personalities and prefer the company of elves, humans, and other fun-loving races while avoiding aggressive beings.

## Ecology
Delphinids sustain themselves using resources from the phlogiston and enjoy being fed fruits from sailors. They give birth to a single calf which both parents raise until it can fend for itself. Their delightful presence can boost the morale of crews in the vastness of space.

## Combat
Delphinids are not aggressive unless provoked and prefer to use ramming attacks if necessary. They can be taught strategic tactics and often engage in creative maneuvers to defend themselves and their companions.

## Society
These creatures are found swimming with the current in the Flow and are more likely to be seen alongside ships traveling at tactical speeds. Sailors appreciate their uplifting presence and may throw treats to them, though their flesh is considered a delicacy by some, which is frowned upon by good-aligned sailors.
