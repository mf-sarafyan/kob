## Overview

## Description
A fractine appears as a two-dimensional, mirrored, trapezoidal plane, resembling a vast mirror. It is typically observed tumbling or folding in wildspace, reacting to various stimuli, particularly motion and magical energy.

## Behavior
Fractines are constantly active and can be manipulated as excellent scrying mirrors when at rest. They are attracted to loud sounds and magic but can be repulsed by large bursts of magical energy. Their behaviors can be influenced by spells that affect air movements.

## Ecology
It remains unclear whether fractines are intelligent or merely spatial phenomena. They feed on life, light, darkness, and magical energy. Upon consuming enough energy, they will leave, and their mobility is affected by the type of energy they consume, increasing with light and decreasing with darkness.
