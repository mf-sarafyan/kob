## Overview

## Description

The Gonn, also known as Gonnlingdaah, are colossal spherical beings from wildspace, resembling gas giants with colorful bands. They communicate through song instead of spoken language, and their appearance can trick inexperienced travelers into thinking they are distant air planets.

## Behavior

Good-natured and pacifistic, the Gonn strive to preserve life and will defend against evil when necessary. They engage in negotiation before resorting to combat, favoring harmonious methods to calm conflict.

## Ecology

Gonn are long-lived, averaging 6,000 years, and live in groups called scales, which consist of eight individuals. They wander wildspace, sharing tales and songs while collecting stories from those they encounter, occasionally giving assistance through spell-like song effects.

## Combat

Though primarily pacifists, Gonn possess powerful songs capable of sonic damage and magical effects, which they use to defend themselves if diplomacy fails. They can sing melodies that soothe or neutralize threats, using their music as their primary means of influence and control.

## Society

Living in groups, the Gonn prefer collective singing and have a rich culture of storytelling through melody. Their names are lengthy songs, and they exchange knowledge for songs, stories, and gems, reflecting their value on artistic exchange.
