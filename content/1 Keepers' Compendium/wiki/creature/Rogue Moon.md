## Overview

## Description
A rogue moon is a gigantic spherical creature, approximately 25 to 250 feet in diameter, and covered in orange to bright yellow scales. It is equipped with two stalks and a large mouth filled with teeth, making it a fearsome predator in wildspace.

## Behavior
These solitary creatures function as ambush predators, luring in prey with their glowing bodies before expanding rapidly to engulf and immobilize them. Their combat strategy includes using spikes to pierce and paralyze victims, as well as employing their large mouth to consume paralyzed prey after battle.

## Ecology
Rogue moons inhabit the dark, remote regions of wildspace and can move by manipulating air through their scales. They reproduce every five years by releasing 'moonspawn', which attracts other rogue moons for fertilization. They can survive extended periods without food but may enter a dormant state if starving.

## Uses
The liver of a rogue moon can be harvested for use in reverse gravity potions, while its venom glands are useful in creating various tranquilizing drugs.
