## Overview

## Description

An airslug is a tiny, jelly-like creature resembling a terrestrial slug, with a healthy specimen exhibiting translucent pale pink, green, or blue colors.

## Behavior

Airslugs serve as detectors for foul or deadly air, changing color from their usual hues to an opaque reddish-brown when exposed to harmful conditions. Spacefarers utilize airslugs by skimming through planetary atmospheres, observing the airslugs' color changes as an indicator of air quality.

## Ecology

Airslugs thrive in various atmospheres, including the void of wildspace. They feed on bacteria and motes present in planetary atmospheres and can absorb light energy, allowing them to sustain themselves. They are commonly found in groups within the flow and wildspace, making them easy to capture in airtight containers.
