## Overview

## Description
Krajen are enormous squid-like predators native to wildspace, capable of growing longer than most ships. In its adult stage, the krajen has a tubelike body dominated by a thick central tentacle, surrounded by a cluster of smaller tentacles.

## Behavior
Adult krajen are solitary creatures that attack anything within their striking distance. They use their huge tentacles to grapple and crush their prey, employing smaller tentacles for protection and to deal with attackers. The krajen will feed on paralyzed victims over several days before moving on in search of new conquests.

## Ecology
Krajen develop through three stages: spore, immature barnacle-like form, and the adult predator. Immature krajen feed on solid surfaces and dead bodies, growing until they can float away and hunt. Adult krajen have no social organization and are immune to their own paralytic poison, preying on various large creatures in wildspace.
