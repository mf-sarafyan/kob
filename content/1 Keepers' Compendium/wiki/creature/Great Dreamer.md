## Overview

## Description
A Great Dreamer is an enormous spacefaring creature resembling a whale, measuring 10 to 20 miles in length and is trilaterally symmetrical. It communicates through broad-band telepathy and has a majestic presence that influences the environment around it.

## Behavior
These creatures are inherently peaceful and prefer to avoid combat, using their beauty and aura to deter threats. When necessary, they can summon elementals and command their entourage, which includes leviathans and delphinids trained for combat.

## Ecology
Great Dreamers play a significant role in the ecological cycles of both aquatic and celestial environments, believed to be responsible for the existence of other cetaceans. They inhabit Wildspace and the phlogiston, often traveling between spheres to attend to the life forms under their guardianship.

## Society
Great Dreamers possess unique social structures, gathering every millennium with the leviathans of various worlds to discuss their guardianship over life. They also hold the power to grant immortality to a being once per year, usually to a cetacean, reflecting their role as cosmic custodians.
