## Overview

## Description

Feesu are large, space-faring moths that travel in swarms surrounded by a glowing green light. They resemble translucent moths and are attracted to light. Their eerie glow often brings them trouble with predators and raiders.

## Behavior

These creatures are not aggressive but will defend themselves if provoked. Their most notable effect on their environment is their ability to pull away air when they leave a spelljamming ship, which can be dangerous for those aboard.

## Ecology

Feesu prefer to inhabit small bodies in wildspace and are known to lay eggs in various locations, including the corners of ships. Their bodily fluids can be utilized as phosphorescent pigment, making them a curious asset for travelers in the phlogiston.
