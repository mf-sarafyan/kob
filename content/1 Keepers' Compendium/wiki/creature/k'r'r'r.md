## Overview

## Description
The k'r'r'r are sentient, spider-like creatures characterized by their vertical body structure, standing 5 to 6 feet tall on stilt-like legs. They are typically dark in color, with shades of black and dark blue, and some rare individuals are sky-blue, considered blessed by their gods.

## Behavior
The k'r'r'r consider themselves the apex of creation, viewing the Known Spheres as resources to exploit. They are driven by a strong belief in their destiny to expand and dominate their surroundings.

## Combat
In combat, the k'r'r'r favor pole arms and piercing weapons, utilizing their speed and strength to overwhelm foes. They can also employ specially modified ranged weapons, although they struggle with slashing weapons and bows.

## Society
The k'r'r'r are fanatical space-faring pirates, believing they have an inherent right to colonize the universe. Their society is organized into unity fleets, which target celestial bodies for colonization and resource exploitation.

## Religion
Their religious structure is centered around their patron deity, the Wise Queen, and is led by the war master, who commands both combat and spiritual aspects of their society.
