## Overview

## Description
Gossamers are spacefaring creatures resembling jellyfish, characterized by their umbrella-shaped bodies and trailing tentacles. They have beautiful color displays that can communicate their mood, with soothing hues of green, blue, and purple mixed with bright flecks of yellow and orange.

## Behavior
They typically travel in groups known as shoals and are scavengers, feeding on leftover organic materials in space. Gossamers utilize stinging tentacles to capture prey and defend themselves, attacking only smaller creatures and avoiding those larger than 1-foot in diameter.

## Ecology
Gossamers depend on weightlessness to maintain their structural integrity, as they collapse under gravity. Upon death, they turn into viscous pools of fluid that contain dangerous enzymes for a short period. This fluid can erupt onto ships if a gossamer is mishandled or collides.

## Gossamer Noble
The gossamer noble is a colony of specialized life forms distinguished by its larger size and unique adaptations for navigating through wildspace. It is a solitary predator equipped with long tentacles that can inflict paralysis and acid damage on its prey, with only the gammaroids as its natural enemies.
