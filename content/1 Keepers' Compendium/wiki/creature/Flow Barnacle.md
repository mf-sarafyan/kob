## Overview

## Description
Flow barnacles are hard-shelled, unintelligent creatures resembling terrestrial limpets or barnacles. They usually measure between 8 to 24 inches long and can be ivory or orange, often turning pinkish when young or wounded. A warning sign of an infestation is the appearance of bone-colored triangular objects on a ship's hull.

## Behavior
These creatures attach limpet-like to objects in wildspace and consume organic and inorganic matter. They drift toward targets and can adhere with a strong grip before using their three beaks to extract nutrients, including blood.

## Ecology
Flow barnacles feed on passing organic matter and do not thrive in excessive heat, light, or air. Some beings consume them for their meat, which is considered rubbery and somewhat poultry- or squid-like in taste, though some humans may be allergic.

## Uses
These creatures produce large, valuable pearls known as "moonpearls" and their hard shells can be used for shields and weapon mounts. Their essence is also used in some forms of glue.
