Thri-kreen Receptionist

The thri-kreen receptionist Sor’kur (pronounced SOAR-ker) is always busy, and there’s no one better suited for the job. Whether she’s sorting mail, passing messages, asking requests for assistance via several sending stones, or handing out welcome packs to new recruits, her multiple arms make it all look easy. Sor’kur has white chitin mottled with patches of brilliant blue, and matching blue eyes.

Quote: “Academy accounts payable, Sor’kur speaking, please hold.”
