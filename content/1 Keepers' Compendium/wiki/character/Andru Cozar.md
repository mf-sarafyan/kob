# Personality
Intelligent and serious, Andru reminded many of his grandfather Cozar. He cared for few people beyond himself; he was conniving and shrewd, and in his plans, he believed that the ends justified the means. Nevertheless, he had a charming personality with a good sense of humor, was a quiet but capable ruler, and showed great skill in diplomacy.
Andru preferred wisdom and patience over force, which caused some to see him as weak.
