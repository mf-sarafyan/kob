# Kip and Pik Whistleslap

![[kip and pik.jpg]]

When nit-picking inane details, four eyes are better than two—something that Kip and Pik Whistleslap make abundantly clear. The two gnome ship inspectors wear meticulously maintained uniforms and the most-feared white gloves in the academy. Both have walnut-colored skin and carefully groomed long black hair, kept in tidy buns. Kip is well known for his no-nonsense attitude, which is complemented by his sister Pik’s quick-witted jovialness. Pik has a red scar down one cheek—a stern reminder of an inspection gone wrong.  
   
**Quirk.** Kip and Pik often finish one another’s sentences, a trait that others sometimes find unnerving.
