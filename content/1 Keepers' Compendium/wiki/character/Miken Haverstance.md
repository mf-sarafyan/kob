**MIKEN HAVERSTANCE**
*Human Cadet*

Miken (MICK-unn) constantly worries about whether he has the right skills to graduate from the Academy. When his nose isn’t buried in a technical manual, he’s scribbling mathematical and arcane equations in a battered pocket notebook he always keeps on him. Miken has light-olive skin, dark-brown eyes, and short, disheveled black hair framing a round face. He wears the same uniform as the other cadets.

# Traição
Miken aceitou um pagamento de [[Vocath]] para fazer um atentado contra a [[Spelljammer Academy]]; mas seu alvo, [[Petty Officer Winston Ryeback]], sobreviveu; e [[Mirt The Merciless]] aceitou que sua punição fosse paga servindo a tripulação dos players.
