# The Naissance

As many of the fun things in Bral, this was a project of dear old Frun. See, in the two or three centuries since its namesake set out to build his outpost, the Rock developed from a temporary hideout into an actual home. A country. 

But it was a country of fragmented peoples; everyone still came from somewhere, _was_ something. Not Bralian. Not united. 

Not yet. 

I'd be lying if I said _"later scholars called it"_; this was a name that Frun himself insisted was used: the **Naissance**. The birth of a culture, of a people. He brought together the greatest artistic minds, the greatest historians and sociologists that this asteroid had to offer (which were more numerous and more competent than you'd expect), and a good old metric fuck-ton of money, and gave them this task. Let's make this city into a country, these folk into one folk.

Since then, the Bralian culture flourished. Paintings, sculptures, architecture, music, poetry, theatre; even today, the Crown patronizes so much - it is in fact one of the few ideas that remained from Frun's reign into Andru's. It can vary in tone and style due to the many influences in the city, but one thing is for sure: it is dramatic, loud, explosive. It is experimental in its striving to be unique; which might sometimes make it tacky or pretentious, but that has never stopped the artistic-minded Bralian. 

Though they still speak mostly the Common tongue, they developed naming conventions, slang, even accents. 

# Naming Conventions

What we perceive as fake, silly italian is just what they kind of came up with. The richer families that had easier access to the Prince when the Naissance begun picked the better-sounding names. The others... did their best. 

So the more macarronic someone's name sounds, the less well-off they'll probably be. You will read stories about the notorious Dottori, Finanzi, Malatesta, Sforzari; but don't trust dudes named, like, Antonio Ravioli. 

### Social Reading of Names
Among Bralians, names are quietly judged:

- **Elegant names** imply legacy, money, or proximity to power.
- **Obvious or literal names** imply labor, trade, or humble origins.
- **Overly elaborate names** often signal _new money_ desperately trying to sound old.

## Name lists 
The different races of Bral ended up gravitating towards common themes when picking surnames. Here are some examples of possibly lesser-known family names.

# Bralian Music 
Naissance music is classy and epic; orchestras, organs, pianos, violins. When giff were involved, the cannon was a common instrument. It started out as a really high-society, Il Veluto thing. 

Folk from the lower tiers of the city viewed this classist development of culture with disdain, and developed their own counter-cultures out of spite - much for Frun's delight. While the orchestras were the music of Montevia, the folk of La Cittá enjoyed chill single-instrument songs with singers, and bard-enhanced punk and metal bands started popping up in Bragora. 

Whatever the genre, they are united in keeping with the Bralian cultural vibe: be experimental, be loud, be distinct, try shit out. 

# Renowned Places of Culture
In [[Montevia]], everywhere is a decadent party; but let's be more specific:
- Lord Hastain's [[La Villa Strangiatto]] is often the debut of many high-society acts;
- The Royal Theatrical Company has productions going on all year long. It's a common meeting place for [[Il Veluto]] discussions... 
- The Man O' War (restaurant) and The Crystal Lamp (tavern) don't go a day without entertainment.

[[La Citta]] has a barrio called [[Il Carnivale]]; you can guess what goes on there. You can't walk through it without having culture shoved in your face. Picture joints overflowing with acts; people on stilts tripping over jugglers while someone plays the accordion. 
- [[Le Terrazze]] is similarily haunted by poets 
- While the merchants sleep, The Grand Bazaar becomes a stage for improptu presentations as well 
- Across the canal, the Aetherium and Campanarium are home to more sober entertainment of the academical or gospel natures.

In [[Bragora]], you'll find the expressions vary wildly between boroughs. 
Every other corner of the Dockside may hide a staircase downwards towards a Cinder punk gig. [[The Laughing Beholder]] is usually haunted by the [[Xenophonics]], but it does support other local artists when possible. 
The Lesser Market is much like the Grand Bazaar, but be aware of the entertainment numbers being more a distraction to pickpocketing or extortion rather then just expression. 
The racial boroughs go through a more melting pot influenced sort of expression, where their native cultures mesh with Bralian influences.  

# Bralian Architecture

Public buildings and infrastructure were among Frun's obsessions (a happy obsession to have for a sort of public servant). Sure, he did spend a fortune commandeering half of the Royal Navy to tow an immense gold-inlaid marble asteroid towards the city just to mine for his own castle, but the guy also built the entire canal and sewer system, hospitals, defenses, rebuilt the Docking Caverns, improved all the Magistrate and Council buildings, sponsored guild halls, habitation, and more. Him and his crew of Royal Architects had more impact on the city's skyline in a couple of decades than its entire previous history combined. 

The fact that the city is such a melting pot of cultures was one of the greatest prides of Frun, and something he did not intend to change during his renewal projects; his guidelines were only to make things amazing. This is why every little Barrio has its own vibe, but they all try to bring the same sense of exaggerated wonder. 

# Bralian School of Painting 

Being one of the few flourishing off-planet cultures, Bralian painting gives us a different view of suns and skies than we're used to. It brings crazy lighting and exaggerated shadows inspired (but not limited) by the asteroid's lack of atmosphere, even in everyday scenes. The movement led to the development of the *bralian black*, a deep purplish dark pigment brewed from a mix of spices, smokepowder and noxious mushrooms that became the quintessential representative of the Rock's skies.
