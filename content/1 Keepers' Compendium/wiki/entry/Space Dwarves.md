# Starborn and Voidborn
This is not a lore that is written. This is a lore that is sung by the fire in half-forgotten rhymes between rock-hewn halls. This is a lore that burns in the blood. This is a lore that is remembered by stone itself. 

Before everything, the Sun was One. 
Then there was a Breath, and the Sun was Divided. 

And from when Sun's first child cooled into rock, there remained a fire: a fire to make and to build and to be many. Like the Sun made itself many, its Oldest would as well. They were the first dwarf. 

And from their fire and the rocks and stardust scattered in the void, they made more. And the Oldest's stone children still burned with the Fire of Creation; and so they traveled the stars to Make. 

Sometimes other stars would die. And the Oldest rejoiced; from their final sparks, they could build another like themself. Not rock-carved: Forjed of stars. And so the void-born, the stone-hewn rejoiced, too, as such a new god was born. 

And sometimes, too, the Oldest's children would make landfall. Make a home upon a world instead of sailing the stars. Far from starfire; far from the Astral, under lesser suns, they would become flesh and blood, like Men, like the creatures of Breath. But their bones remember the stone, and their blood remembers the fire.
