The Unhuman Wars were significant conflicts between various goblinoid fleets and the Elven Imperial Navy within the Spelljammer campaign setting. The wars marked a critical moment in history, consolidating the Elven Navy's dominance in wildspace for centuries.

## History
The First Unhuman War began due to persistent goblinoid raids on elven and human communities, prompting the Elven Fleet to declare total war against them. It led to significant battles, including the pivotal Battle of Kule, where the elves decisively defeated a goblinoid fleet.

## Conflict
The wars saw various tactics and alliances formed, including the deployment of undead as defensive measures and human-illithid alliances for protective convoys. Both sides developed advanced biological weapons, with orcs creating witchlight marauders and elves developing bionoids and spirit warriors.

## Aftermath
