# Gobbspace

A heavily industrialized sphere populated primarily by goblinoids. After the [[Unhuman Wars|Inhuman Wars]], the elves forbade its inhabitants from possessing spelljamming technology; instead of remaining planetbound, the goblins developed their own mundane means of traveling between the worlds of their sphere.

Modern Gobbspace is ruled by the [[Grand Goblin Assembly]], which rose from the industrial order that replaced the old [[Goblinoid Chieftains|chieftain]] realms.
