# The Library of the Spheres

Serves as the regional headquarters of [[The Seekers]], and contains an impressive collection of books, tomes, scrolls, and manuscripts of all descriptions. The city of Bral is too young to warrant a library of this size, but the Seekers were forced to move two of their smaller collections to Bral about 30 years ago. These two collections account for the majority of books found in the library.

Its head librarian and keeper is [[Marvo Threnn]], an eccentric vegan mind flayer.
