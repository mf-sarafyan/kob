# Piazza Sindarina

Against the walls where [[La Citta]] meets [[Viscura]], right below [[The Man O' War]] in [[Montevia]], a miracle grows amid the city: a mystical grove of enchanted birch, laurel, ash and oak trees, many of which appear to be several hundred years old; possibly the most beautiful place in the asteroid. Enchantments ensure those who have no business there quickly find themselves outside, in marvel and slight confusion.
