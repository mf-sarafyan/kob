# **Karpri**

This water world has icecaps at its poles and vegetation-choked waters in its equatorial region. In between, on either side of the equatorial zone, are bands of featureless ocean—nothing but water as far as the eye can see. Most of the planet’s indigenous creatures are aquatic and dwell in the tropical sargasso, since the planet has no land masses that can support life.
