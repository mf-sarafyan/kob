# The Man O' War

Flowered terraces climbing the cliff from [[La Citta]] up toward [[Montevia]] offer a spectacular view of the city and Wildspace as the most distinguished citizens of the city dine in one of the finest inns and restaurants of any sphere. Dress code and good conduct are enforced by not only highly payed mercenaries, but the eyes of the highest of society. The plush suites are often reserved by diplomats or other high-ranking visitors.
