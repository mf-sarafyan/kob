# The Arena of Frun

An impressive stadium of the same white granite used in the palace. Although the Arena can seat 500 people comfortably, the facility is rarely opened to the public. Once a year, on Charter Day (the anniversary of Cozar's coronation), a series of games and races, including jumping contests and mock gladiatorial fights, are held for the public to celebrate.

While these contests may attract some attention, most of the more bloodthirsty citizens of the city prefer to patronize the illegal pit fights of the Low City. The Arena is occasionally used by duelists as a neutral ground to resolve their differences.
