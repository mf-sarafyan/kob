# The Laughing Beholder

**The Laughing Beholder** is a staple of the Low City, owned by its namesake, the smiling **[[Luigi Zenonni|Large Luigi]]** - who often mixes and delivers drinks using his *telekinesis eye rays*. His second-in-command is Commodore Krux, who also takes care of Luigi's green parrot. It is a spacious inn with a very high ceiling - so the owner can float around - held up by arched pillars in red and gold, and serves not only local Brailian ales and wines but from all over the Known Spheres.
