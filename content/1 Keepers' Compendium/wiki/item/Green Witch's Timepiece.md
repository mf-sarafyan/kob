A complex clockwork device mounted on a wristband, carefully tuned to the Green Clock of Mechanus and the local flow of time.
Different hands circle around minor displays, tracking: 
- The current universally-tracked date and time @ GMT
- The current timeflow relative to GMT - that is: "one minute in my current location means X time in GMT".
- If manually adjusted to local standards, it can also function as a normal clock.
