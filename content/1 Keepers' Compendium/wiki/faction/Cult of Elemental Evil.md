Here‚Äôs a summary of the tangled, glorious web of _The Feather of Zariel_ adventure as it stands‚Äîwoven around **identity, exploitation, and the slow horror of being treated like a thing**.

---

## THE CENTRAL THREAD: THE FEATHER

**What it is:**  [[Little Feather]]
A sentient childlike entity. A Splinter of Zariel, split off when she used incredible power to take Elturel into the Hells,
She is a volatile, confused creature of celestial and fiendish nature, but full of wonder and desire to learn about the world.  
**Asmodeus** extracted her via a contractual loophole during _Descent into [[Avernus]]_. If she is a splinter of Zariel, then she is an archdevil, and the archdevils are under Asmodeus' orders. He had her delivered to **[[Greyhawk]]** to be disposed of quietly‚Äîvia exploitation, transaction, or corruption.

**Where she is now:**  
In the vaults of the **[[Purple Wyrm Bank]]**, held as a ‚Äúvolatile divine asset‚Äù under **[[Davis Nuben]]**, a secret dragon and greedy mastermind.  
He‚Äôs negotiating with multiple factions to sell her to the highest bidder.

---

## üé≠ THE FACTIONS

### **The [[Purple Wyrm Bank]]**
- Revolutionized the monetary system in Greyhawk by pretty much inventing fantasy credit cards. Became the most lucrative operation in the city. Corporate evil incarnate.
- Sees the Feather as **pure value**: a tradable asset. Being courted from all sides. 
- Run by **David Nuben**, secretly a dragon
- Guards the Feather in magical vaults staffed by devils, constructs, and legal traps.
- [[Aimra'at Jorp]] (see below) works here.


### **[[Cult of Elemental Evil]]** / [[The Harmonic Way]]
- The Elemental Evil was dismantled about 7 years ago (one year after Baang left). 
- Now it's The Harmonic Way, a sort of wellness cult with apocalyptic cult infiltrated. But the other way around - created to hide an apocalyptic cult, but developed into a well-meaning, somewhat misguided doctrine.
- The Way:
	- If anything, would want nature to return to balance. Give her back to Zariel.
- The Evil:
	- Sees the Feather as a **ritual convergence**‚Äîdivine and elemental energy fused. So much Fiery power to absorb.
	- Wants to use her to **tear holes** in planar reality, unleash elemental chaos.
	- Baang‚Äôs old faction‚Äîhe was a sacred conduit, now a traitor.

### **[[Cult of Iuz]]** / [[Freeblades]]
- The cult of Iuz has always been infiltrated into Greyhawk. Its current iteration are the Freeblades, an mix of street gang and anarcho-capitalist cryptocult.
- "Power is law. Money is blood. Blood is money."
- Believes the Feather is a _weapon or vessel_. Wants to **bind her to their god**, or fuse her with a chosen body.
- Vax is seen as a potential _chosen one_ or _sacrificial match_‚Äîhe resembles Iuz‚Äôs monstrous form.
- May attempt a **ritual pairing** between Vax and the Feather.



###  [[The Church of Pelor]]

- Benevolent, but paternalistic. 
- Paladins and angelic forces believe the child is the _key to Zariel‚Äôs redemption_.
- Want to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù her‚Äîbut in doing so, risk _removing her agency_ entirely.
- Represented by **Seraphina Dawnsworn**, a fervent aasimar who would sacrifice the child to save the archduchess.

### 5. üßä [[Asmodeus]]

- Orchestrated the Feather‚Äôs extraction, but left the rest to mortal avarice.
- Playing the long game: if she is corrupted, sold, or destroyed, that‚Äôs a win.
- May eventually appear through an envoy (e.g. **Malvyr Lethe**), smugly stating ‚ÄúI simply protected my assets.‚Äù

## üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è THE PARTY‚ÄôS CONNECTIONS

### üêà‚Äç‚¨õ **[[Vax]]**

- Warlock, bred to be a sacred vessel.
- Thinks his patron may be **[[Iuz]]** or **Fraz-Urb‚Äôluu**.
- It's actually **Tasha**, who‚Äôs letting the ambiguity play out for her amusement.
- May be worshipped by Iuz cultists as a _chosen one_, or target of a _dark union ritual_.
- Grappling with his **sense of self vs. outside projection**.

### üå™Ô∏è **[[Baang]]**
- Air genasi, formerly of the Elemental Cult.
- Trained as a conduit, escaped with help (or betrayal) from **La Morena**.
- Reconnecting with old rivals and being dragged back into the cult‚Äôs obsession.
- Torn between **past ritual trauma** and **present feelings**.

### üî• **La Morena**: [[Aimra'at Jorp]]

- Fire genasi, works in the **Purple Wyrm Bank**.
- High-level asset manager tied to both the Bank and the Cult.
- Secretly trying to do good‚Äîfeeds information to the **Keepers of the Balance**.
- Cares for Baang deeply, but sees no way out of her current life without _great cost_.

## NPCs 
 
**The Gaang (From Baang's Past). All involved with the Elemental Evil is some way:**
- ü™® [[Pyotr Pebbles]] (Peps)
	- Earth genasi with Stone Giant Seer heritage.
	- A **financial advisor** and **part-time diviner**, fond of tarot cards.
	- Baang's former roomate. Friendly to the party, but sometimes condescending.
- üêâ **[[Little Gargol]] (Gargalinho)**
	- Tiny, mouthy gargoyle wearing glasses.
	- Runs a lot of errands (since he flies), but is surprisingly senior-ranking in the Purple Wyrm Bank.
- [[Chikorita]]
	- Dryad? Or Something? 
	- Baang's old flame, so she's Morena's rival. 
- [[Claws]], Baang's nerdy and reserved brother. 
	- Probably still a part of the cult, but out of self-interest, not to destroy the world or anything. 
- Obviously, [[Aimra'at Jorp|Morena]], Baang's love interest. 
- Maybe a couple more friends?
- An old boss or authoritarian father figure that sort-of-raised and sort-of-exploited Baang. 

There are certainly higher-ups in the Cult involved: Baang's old gang could be a pathway towards them. 
**Elemental Evil Survivors:**
- **Thrommel**, the vampire prince. Now undercover as the **Bloodletter**: a physician offering "humor rebalancing" through bleeding. 
- **Varachan**, once Water Temple commander. The only one truly redeemed: an elf, former high priest of Tharizdun, now running charity for the Harmonic Way. 
- **Barkinar**, Earth temple commander. Could be a figure with ties to Peps. 
- **Hedrack, reborn**: dropped the EE fa√ßade and is now the lead thinker for the Freeblades. Olav√£o. 
- **Senshock**, former head of the Air Thieves. Now where? 
- **Kelno**, also from the Air Temple. Now Where? 
- **Tessimmon**, once high priestess of the Fire. Probably used to have ties to Morena.

**The Cultists of Iuz (From Vax's Past):**
- Vax's human mother, father and sister; they do treat him only as a *thing*, a ritual conduit. Or maybe just one of them survived - sister?
	- A new conduit; a younger, better Vax - more focused to the cause. They learnt from their mistakes.
- Some friendly teacher figure. 
- What else? Create some more Freeblades NPCs. 

**Purple Wyrmlings**:
- Some NPCs related to Morena - maybe like 2 or 3 underlings, and 2 bosses that report to Mr. Nuben 

**Church of Pelor:**
A few approachable, honest priests; led by a bishop or something who is a really sweet old man (but wants to USE the Feather, as a weapon, as if she's not a person). 
[[Sarana]], canonically the archpriest of the temple. 
??? - a sort of black-sheep paladin under training, Seelah from WOTR vibe. Could have former ties to Baang/Vax from a rough past.

## üéØ CAMPAIGN THEMES

- **‚ÄúEvil is when you treat people as things.‚Äù**
- Identity, commodification, trauma recovery.
- Players must navigate a web where _everyone wants something from the child, from Baang, from Vax... and maybe from themselves._
- The real conflict isn‚Äôt which side to fight‚Äîit‚Äôs **who gets to define what the Feather, and the PCs, _are_**.
