**PETTY OFFICER WINSTON RYEBACK**

*Giff Galley Cook*

Petty Officer Ryeback (RIE-bak) is a muscular giff in charge of the food served at the Academy (and on the rare occasion, he crews a ship). Like anyone else who runs a respectable galley, he’s a staunch believer in the four basic food groups: beans, bacon, whiskey, and lard. He’s raucous and brash and gives bear hugs so good you think he might break a rib (but in a good way). His gray skin is usually coated with light sheen of sweat; kitchens are hot!

Quote: “The best way to someone’s heart is through their stomach.”
