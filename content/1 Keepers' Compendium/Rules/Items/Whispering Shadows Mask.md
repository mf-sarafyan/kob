_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a Warlock)_

This sleek, obsidian-black mask is crafted to fit snugly over a Tabaxi's feline mouth, blending seamlessly into the shadows. Intricate designs etched into the mask give it an air of ancient mystery.

**Properties:**

- **Veil of Deception:** While wearing the Whispering Shadows Mask, the wearer gains advantage on Deception checks. The mask obscures the wearerâ€™s true intentions, making it difficult for others to read them.
    
- **Subtle Spell Focus:** Once per day, the Whispering Shadows Mask can be used as a spellcasting focus, granting the wearer the ability to use the Metamagic option _Subtle Spell_ on one spell they cast. This ability recharges at sunrise or upon rolling a 1 or 20 on a d20 during any check or saving throw.
