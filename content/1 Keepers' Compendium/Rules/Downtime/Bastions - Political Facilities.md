Political facilities differ from [[Bastions - Business Facilities]] in that they can all take the same orders, but they have passive effects that may improve them. 

Each facility can take one of these orders:

# Facility Effects

When you get a new Political Facility, you choose from one of the following abilities. You can skin the ability as you like - a hireling with connections, a safe space away from view, a secret contract with a guild. 

## Backdoor Channel

Choose a style for your facility (Physical, Social, Bureaucratic). **Order: Court** from this facility towards factions of that style won't cause negative favours from other active factions.

Example: You have a Physical *Backdoor Channel* and Il Veluto are active; you can still Court the Cinders and avoid the negative favour with Veluto. 


## Obvious Front

Choose a style for your facility (Physical, Social, Bureaucratic). **Order: Court** from this facility towards any factions won't cause negative favours from other active factions of the chosen style.

Example: You have a Physical *Obvious Front* and the Cinders are active; you can still Court the Veluto and avoid the negative favour with the Cinders. 


## Targeted Decorations 
Choose a style for your facility (Physical, Social, Bureaucratic). **Order: Cash-in** with factions of that style costs 1 less for Meetings (increasing Standing).

## Undeniable Requests
Choose a style for your facility (Physical, Social, Bureaucratic). **Order: Cash-in** with factions of that style costs 1 less for non-Meetings (material and story rewards).

## Ear to the Ground
You can **Order: Contest** negative events in other tiers (any style). 

## Offensively Malleable
Choose two styles; **Order: Contests** you choose to trigger (from options in events) have advantage against both.

## Bulwark
Choose two styles; on **Order: Contests** triggered against you, you have advantage against both.

## Quick Deploy
You can **Order: Help Contest** from this facility. Spend your order on this facility to add **1d6** to an ally's Contest in any city tier. This adds advantage to both your and your allies' rolls if your Style beats the opponent's.
