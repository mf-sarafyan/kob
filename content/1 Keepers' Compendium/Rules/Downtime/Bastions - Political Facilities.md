Political facilities differ from [[Bastions - Business Facilities]] in that they can all take the same orders, but they have passive effects that may improve them. 

Each facility can take one of these orders: 

![[Factions - Political Orders]]

When you get a new Political Facility, you choose from one of the following abilities. You can skin the ability as you like - a hireling with connections, a safe space away from view, a secret contract with a guild. 

Choosed a style for your facility (Physical, Social, Bureaucratic). The benefit applies for factions of that style. 

- **Order: Court** from this facility towards factions of its style won't cause negative favours from other active factions.
- **Order: Court** from this facility towards any factions won't cause negative favours from other active factions of this facility's style.
- **Order: Cash-in** costs 1 less for Meetings (increasing Standing).
- **Order: Cash-in** costs 1 less for non-Meetings (material and story benefits).
- You can **Order: Contest** negative events in other tiers (any style).  
- Choose two styles; **Order: Contests** you trigger offensively have advantage against both.
- Choose two styles; on **Order: Contests** triggered against you, you have advantage against both.
- You can **Order: Help Contest.** Spend your order on this facility to add **1d6** to an ally's Contest in any city tier. This adds advantage to both your and your allies' rolls if your Style beats the opponnent's.
