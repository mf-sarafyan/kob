### Earning & Losing Favours (typical)
- **Patronage (low profile).** Offer donations, service, or access to **one faction**. Gain **+1 Favour** with that faction.
- **Enforcement (high profile).** Visible work—protection, muscle, resources—for **one faction**. Gain **+2 Favours** with that faction. (The DM may also apply **−1 Favour** with a plausible rival.)
- **Cool‑Off**:  Apologies, gifts, and PR to improve footing with **one faction**. Clears up to **2 negative Favours** with target faction.
- **Political friction & fallout:** whenever fiction or a table entry would cause trouble with a faction, apply **−1 Favour** with that faction.

> **Cross‑Faction Attention.** Active factions may alter these actions significantly - check [[Bastions#Faction Events]]. 

### Spending Favours (Cash-in & Meetings)

| Ask                 | Cost  | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------- | :---: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Minor Cash-in**   | **1** | Common goods worth around 20GP per level (more with higher standing), a simple NPC introduction, safe passage, lookout detail, or simple paperwork.                                                                         |
| **Major Cash-in**   | **2** | Rare or restricted goods worth around 50GP per level (more with higher standing). Looking the other way on something significant. An introduction to an important faction member. Trading for favours with another faction. |
| **Greater Cash-in** | **3** | Very rare or forbidden goods worth around 100GP per level. Meeting a leader or adjacent faction member. More permanent paperwork. Strikes on rival factions. Lowering Wanted from another faction.                          |
| **Meeting**         | **3** | Formal audience; raises Standing by **+1**.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

- **Cash-in Checks.** When uncertainty exists, call for a check at **DC 10 (Minor), 15 (Major), 20 (Greater)** using an appropriate skill (usually Persuasion). Each **additional Favour** spent on the same Pull grants **+2** to the check.

**Checks (when uncertain).** Use **DC 10/15/20** for Minor/Major/Greater. Each **extra Favour** sweetened on the same Pull grants **+2** to the roll. At the DM’s discretion, very high or low **Standing** might grant advantage/disadvantage on social Pulls.


#### Meetings (Advancing Standing)
A **Meeting** is a formal audience to change long‑term relations.

- **Cost.** **3 Favours** with that faction, that are consumed.
- **Effect.** Raises your Standing by **+1**.
- **Time.** Takes your Faction Action during a Bastion Turn unless a political ability or event waives the action cost.
- **Checks.** Usually none; if the fiction is uncertain, use **Persuasion DC 15**.
