# Overview: Major Factions
Each character tracks their relationship with every faction using **two dials**—simple, fast, and always in motion:

- **Standing (−6…+6).** A faction’s long‑term attitude toward the character.
- **Favours (can be negative).** A single running balance with that faction. Positive values are goodwill you can spend; negative values are **debts/ill‑will** that make life harder until repaid.

Factions react during Bastion Turns (see [[Bastions2]]), and your choices in play nudge these two dials up or down.

## Major Factions

[[La Mano Legata]]:
- [[Cartocci]]  
    Strong‑armed bureaucrats whose stamps and permits can starve a shop—or flood it with supply. Favour eases materials; enmity drowns you in taxes and delays.
- [[Zenonni]]  
    A society of odd specialists. Their arrivals bring chaos—sometimes priceless, sometimes costly.
- [[Malvessi]]  
    Mobsters in pirate trim. They plunder, but share with friends. Enemies see sabotage and violence; allies can point them at targets.
- [[Il Velluto]]  
    High society arbiters. A word from them can ruin or exalt; your place with them mirrors your place in salons and stages.    
- [[Luminari]]  
    Whisper‑makers of the streets. If the lamps like you, doors open.  
[[Cinders]]  
    Enemies of the status quo, armed with fire and powder. Winning them over angers others—but can upend the city’s balance. Relentless as enemies or allies.  
[[Monarquia Braliana]]  
    The crown can override or reinforce any impediment other factions put in your way.


These are the major players of Bralian politics. Each character tracks **Standing** and **Favours** with each.

# Standing Scale (Single Meter)
Standing is a number from **−6** to **+6**. Named breakpoints anchor the fiction:

- **−6** _(War)_ → **−3** _(Hostile)_ → **−1** _(Interfering)_ → **0** _(Neutral)_ → **+1** _(Helpful)_ → **+3** _(Friendly)_ → **+6** _(Allied)_

- **War (−6 Standing).** Will go out of their way to hurt you even if it’s not in their best interest to do so. 
- **Hostile (−3 Standing).** Will look for opportunities to hurt you as long as it doesn’t create serious problems for them. Expect same from you, and take precautions against you.
- **Interfering (−1 Standing).** Will look for opportunities to cause you trouble (or profit from your misfortune) if it causes no problems or significant cost to them. Expect same from you.
- **Neutral (0 Standing).**
- **Helpful (+1 Standing).** Will help if it causes no problems or significant cost for them. Expect the same.
- **Friendly (+3 Standing).** Will help if it doesn’t create serious problems for them. Expect same from you.
- **Allied (+6 Standing).** Will help even if it’s not in their best interest do so. Expect same from you.

> **Starting Standing.** Unless noted, characters begin at **−1 (Interfering)** with all factions. **Zenonni** commonly start **0 (Neutral)**.

### Changing Standing
Standing moves by **spending or losing Favours**—no extra clocks.

- **Raising Standing (your choice).** Hold a **Meeting** with a faction and **spend 3 Favours** to increase your Standing by **+1**. (You can purchase multiple steps in separate Meetings.)
- **Falling Standing (automatic).** Whenever your Favours with a faction drop to **−3 or lower**, immediately reduce your Standing by **−1** and remove 3 negative-favours.

# Favours (Positive & Negative)
**Favours** are your currency with a faction. The balance may be **positive** (stored goodwill) or **negative** (debts/ill‑will).

### Earning & Losing Favours (typical)
- **Patronage** (low profile): **+1 Favour** with the target faction.
- **Enforcement** (high profile): **+2 Favours** with the hiring faction; usually **−1 Favour** with one plausible rival (DM call).
- **Cool‑Off** (apology/PR): Clears up to **2 negative Favours** with target faction.
- **Political friction & fallout:** whenever fiction or a table entry would cause trouble with a faction, apply **−1 Favour** with that faction.

> **Cross‑Faction Attention.** If at least one faction is **active** in the district, doing **Patronage** or **Enforcement** for a **non‑active** faction assigns **−1 Favour** with one active faction that plausibly resents it (DM decides; particularly inflammatory acts may ding two).

### Spending Favours (Cash-in & Meetings)

| Ask                 | Cost  | Notes                                                                    |
| ------------------- | :---: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Minor Cash-in**   | **1** | Simple permit, introduction, lookout, small squad for a scene.           |
| **Major Cash-in**   | **2** | Restricted access, forged papers, squad for an op, quash a minor case.   |
| **Greater Cash-in** | **3** | Close docks, cutter & crew, erase a case, shut a rival down for a night. |
| **Meeting**         | **2** | Formal audience; each Meeting you pay for can raise Standing by **+1**.  |

**Checks (when uncertain).** Use **DC 10/15/20** for Minor/Major/Greater. Each **extra Favour** sweetened on the same Pull grants **+2** to the roll. At the DM’s discretion, very high or low **Standing** might grant advantage/disadvantage on social Pulls.

---

# Meetings (Advancing Standing)
A **Meeting** is a formal audience to change long‑term relations.

- **Cost.** **3 Favours** with that faction.
- **Effect.** Raises your Standing by **+1** (you may not jump more than once per Meeting).
- **Time.** Takes your Faction Action during a Bastion Turn unless a political ability waives the action cost.
- **Checks.** Usually none; if the fiction is uncertain, use **Persuasion DC 15** (advantage at a site **Tagged** for that faction).


---

# Tags (Bastion Synergy) -  todo
*Não sei se isso vai ficar assim tho*
A Bastion can have up to **two Tags** linking it to districts or factions (earned via upgrades or story).

- **Patronage at a Tagged site:** **+1 Favour** with that faction.
- **Meeting at a Tagged site:** Advantage on related checks.
- **Enforcement launched from a Tagged site:** On success, shift **+1 Favour** with that faction (reduces a negative by 1 if applicable).

_Examples (wip):_  
Hookah Bar (Entertainment) — Tags: **Il Velluto**, **Luminari**.  
Soffiera Workshop — Tags: **Cinders**, **Zenonni**.

# Using the Module
1. **Track per character × faction:** **Standing (−6…+6)** and a single **Favours** balance (may be negative).
2. **Resolve actions:** Patronage **+1**, Enforcement **+2** (and usually **−1** to a rival), Cool‑Off **+1**. Apply fiction‑based penalties as **−1 Favour**.
3. **Spend as needed:** Minor/Major/Greater Pulls **1/2/3**; **Meeting 2** to raise Standing **+1**.
4. **Auto‑slide:** When Favours ≤ **−2**, Standing auto‑drops **−1**, then Favours bump **+2** (repeat until **≥ −1**).
5. **Approaches & Attacks:** Use _Bastions2_ for district **Approaches** (bands, economy) and **Sea Storm** attacks; those rules reference Standing and Favours directly.

# Quick Reference (Player‑Facing)
- **Standing:** −6 (War)…−3 (Hostile)…−1 (Interfering)…0…+1 (Helpful)…+3 (Friendly)…+6 (Allied).
- **Earn:** Patronage **+1**; Enforcement **+2** (and usually **−1** with a rival); Cool‑Off **+1**.
- **Spend:** Minor/Major/Greater Pull = **1/2/3**; **Meeting = 2** to raise Standing **+1**.
- **Debt drag:** At **Favours ≤ −2**, Standing drops **−1** and Favours rebound **+2** (repeat as needed).
- **Courting outsiders:** If a faction is **active**, doing Patronage/Enforcement for a **non‑active** faction usually causes **−1 Favour** with one active faction.

# Minor Factions
Minor factions aren’t tracked with Standing or Favours by default and don’t act on Bastion Turns.

Examples: a specific noble house (e.g., Lord Gamalon), the Dracon Embassy, the Dwarven Guilds, small gangs, or singular powers (e.g., being close to **Luigi Zenonni** without having pull with the entire crew).

You can **Ally** a minor faction via story or dedicated downtime; they grant a bespoke, minor boon to your Bastion. You can only be allied to **one** minor faction at a time.
