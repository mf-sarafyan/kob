# Political Orders
Different from Business Orders, Political Orders are common to all political facilities; facilities just improve their effects. These orders interact with player-faction status by altering Favours and Standing. **Faction Events** (see below) also alter the outputs of these orders. 

**Order: Court.** Offer service or show favoritism to a chosen faction. **Gain one favour** with a chosen faction. 
- If you chose the **current active faction** for your district, you gain **one additional favour.**
- If you didn't choose the **current active faction** for your district, you **lose one favour with that active faction.** They're unhappy to see you favoring someone else in their turf. 

**Order: Cash-in.** Trade in your good-will for some more permanent benefits. Use your Political Order and **spend 3 favours with a faction** and choose one: 
- Call a meeting, a formal audience with an important faction member to **increase your standing with the faction by 1**. 
- Trade for a hard-to-find, rare or forbidden item, worth around **100 GP x character level**. Usually consumable magic items or Essence (see [[Crafting]]). 
- Call in a favour to advance the story, such as **access to Obliviate logs**. 
- Establish contact with an important faction member NPC. 

> These are examples, other ideas may come up during play.

> Standing tiers (Friendly +3 or Allied +6) will increase the value of favour cash-ins! Factions won't comply with riskier asks for people they're not intimate with.

**Order: Contest. (Special)** This order is available when a faction **has a negative event in your district** - the DM will let you know. It will trigger a **Contest** against that faction! If you win, you (and other allies) will avoid negative effects from that event, but if you lose, you're spending your Political Order and risking a **counter-attack** that can disable other facilities in your Bastion.
