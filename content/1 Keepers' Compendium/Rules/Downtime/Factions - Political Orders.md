*Again, this won't make sense without reading [[Faction Relations]]...*

Different from Business Orders, Political Orders are common to all political facilities; facilities just improve their effects. These orders interact with player-faction status by altering Favours and Standing. **Faction Events** (see below) also alter the outputs of these orders. 

**Political Order: Court Faction.** Offer service or show favoritism. **Gain one favour** with a chosen faction. 
- If you chose the **current active faction** for your district, you gain **one additional favour.**
- If you didn't choose the **current active faction** for your district, you **lose one favour with that active faction.** They're unhappy to see you favoring someone else in their turf. 

**Political Order: Spend Favours.** Trade in your good-will for some more permanent benefits. Use your Political Order and **spend 3 favours with a faction** and choose one: 
- Call a meeting, a formal audience with an important faction member to **increase your standing with the faction by 1**. 
- Trade for a hard-to-find, rare or forbidden item, worth around **100 GP x character level**. Usually consumable magic items or Essence (see [[Crafting]]). 
- Call in a favour to advance the story, such as **access to Obliviate logs**. 
- Establish contact with an important faction member NPC. 

> These are examples, other ideas may come up during play.

> Standing tiers (Friendly +3 or Allied +6) will increase the value of favour cash-ins! Factions won't comply with riskier asks for people they're not intimate with.

**Special Political Order: Contest Dominance.** This order is available when a faction **has a negative approach to your district**. (todo) (Trigger treta e limpa os debuffs se ganhar)

You can only take one Political Action per turn: it represents your approach towards your relationship with factions for the week. 

### Favour-earning Actions
- **PA: Patronage (low profile).** Offer donations, service, or access to **one faction**. Gain **+1 Favour** with that faction.
- **PA: Enforcement (high profile).** Visible work—protection, muscle, resources—for **one faction**. Gain **+2 Favours** with that faction and **at least -1 Favour** with the active faction (see [[Bastions#Faction Events]]).
- **PA: Cool‑Off**:  Apologies, gifts, and PR to improve footing with **one faction**. Clears up to **2 negative Favours** with target faction.

**Political friction & fallout:** whenever fiction or a table entry would cause trouble with a faction, apply **−1 Favour** with that faction.

> **Cross‑Faction Attention.** Active factions may alter these actions significantly - check [[Bastions#Faction Events]]. 

### Favour-spending Actions

| Ask                     | Cost (Favours) | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | :------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PA:  Minor Cash-in**  |     **1**      | Common goods worth around 20GP per level (more with higher standing), a simple NPC introduction, safe passage, lookout detail, or simple paperwork.                                                                         |
| **PA:  Major Cash-in**  |     **2**      | Rare or restricted goods worth around 50GP per level (more with higher standing). Looking the other way on something significant. An introduction to an important faction member. Trading for favours with another faction. |
| **PA: Greater Cash-in** |     **3**      | Very rare or forbidden goods worth around 100GP per level. Meeting a leader or adjacent faction member. More permanent paperwork. Strikes on rival factions. Lowering Wanted from another faction.                          |
| **PA: Meeting**         |     **3**      | Formal audience; raises Standing by **+1**.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

- **Cash-in Checks.** When uncertainty exists, call for a check at **DC 10 (Minor), 15 (Major), 20 (Greater)** using an appropriate skill (usually Persuasion). Each **additional Favour** spent on the same Pull grants **+2** to the check.

**Checks (when uncertain).** Use **DC 10/15/20** for Minor/Major/Greater. Each **extra Favour** sweetened on the same Pull grants **+2** to the roll. At the DM’s discretion, very high or low **Standing** might grant advantage/disadvantage on social Pulls.


#### Meetings (Advancing Standing)
A **Meeting** is a formal audience to change long‑term relations.

- **Cost.** **3 Favours** with that faction, that are consumed.
- **Effect.** Raises your Standing by **+1**.
- **Time.** Takes your Faction Action during a Bastion Turn unless a political ability or event waives the action cost.
- **Checks.** Usually none; if the fiction is uncertain, use **Persuasion DC 15**.
