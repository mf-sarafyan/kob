# Summary

A **Bastion** is a character’s seat of influence in Bral—part home, part workshop, part political machine. During downtime, the campaign switches to **Bastion Turns**, which take about 7 days each. In each Bastion Turn, characters can improve their holdings, craft items, recruit crew, cultivate faction ties, and prepare for the next venture.

This section presents the shared framework your table will use every time Bastions come into play. Specific political or business facilities, crafting, and faction procedures are described in their own chapters.

---

## Running a Bastion Turn
A Bastion Turn represents roughly a week of focused effort, meetings, and maintenance. Each step is detailed on the sections below.

***Sequence of Play***
1. ***Declare Bastion Participation*.** Each character who is present in Bral may take Bastion actions this turn.
2. ***Faction Event Checks*.** Each Bastion Turn has one Faction active in each of the city's tiers. We roll for Bragora and La Città; then for each active faction, we roll to determine its approach. Player standing, heat and favours with the active faction can improve or worsen the results. 
3. ***Players Choose Actions*.** Each participating character takes **one Business Action** for each of their facilities, and **one Political Action**. 
4. ***Resolve Actions*.** Apply facility modifiers, political abilities, and any debuffs/boons from faction events.
5. ***Update Tracks*.** Record Favours, Heat, Wanted, gold earned/spent, project progress, and any facility changes.

> **DM Guidance.** Keep the tempo brisk. Ask each player for their planned action(s) up front, roll the necessary faction tables, then resolve outcomes in a single pass.

---

## Actions
Bastion play is divided into two families of actions: **Business Actions** (money and projects) and **Political Actions** (politics and reputation). Unless a rule states otherwise, each character may take **one of each** per Bastion Turn.

### Business Actions
- **Trade.** The Bastion earns coin through rents, enterprises, and sales. Standard payout is  **20 gp × character level** but facilities can alter that.
    - If the characters are not in Bral, Bastions automatically do Trade. Business as usual. 
- **Craft.** Begin or advance a project (mundane or magical). See [[Crafting]] for time, assistants, tool requirements, and Essence rules.
    - Modifiers from **Business** facilities (workshops, laboratories) apply here.
- **Recruit**. Players can recruit Spelljammer crew or hirelings for their bastions. TODO! 
- **Empower, harvest, etc.** - specific actions for each facility.

### Political Actions
*More on [[Faction Relations]]
- **Patronage (Low Profile).** Offer donations, service, or access to a single faction. Grants 1d4-1 (minimum 1) **Favours** with a selected faction. 
- **Enforcement (High Profile).** Do visible work - protection, muscle, outright favoring, providing resources - for one faction. Grants 1d4+1 **Favours** with the selected faction, and 1d4-1 **Heat** with the current active faction(s) if they're not selected. 
- **Cool-Off.** Reduce **Heat** with a single faction by 1d4-1 by laying low and through apologies, gifts, and PR. Each **100 gp** or **1 Favour** from any other faction further decreases **Heat** by 1.
- **Meeting.** Invite faction emissaries for a formal audience to increase **Standing**. Meetings usually cost **5 Favours** from that faction; see **Faction Relations** for the Standing ladder and how Meetings interact with Wanted.
- **Cash-in.** Spend favours for a reward. Can be minor (2 favours, ~20gp/level), major (4 favours, ~50gp/level) or a Big Ask (7 favours, ~100gp/level). Might require a skill check. 

> **Shortcuts & Swaps.** Political abilities (see **Political Bastions**) may compress or discount these actions—for example, holding one Meeting at **4 Favours** without consuming your action, or causing an Enforcement to generate less Heat.

---

## Facilities
Facilities are the rooms, staff, and agreements that give a Bastion its bite. A facility is either **Business** (money and projects) or **Political** (Meetings, Pulls, Patronage, Enforcement, Cool-Off). You can skin a political ability as a room, a hireling, or a contract; mechanically, the ability is what matters.

***Gaining a basic facility.*** Expanding your holdings in a place where space is at a premium has its costs, in time and resources.

| Facility Space | Cost     | Time Required |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------- |
| Basic          | 500 GP   | 3 turns       |
| Fine           | 1,000 GP | 5 turns       |
| Luxurious      | 3,000 GP | 10 turns      |

***Improving Basic Facilities***. Improving a basic facility to Luxurious unlocks modifiers for Political Actions. A character can spend money and time to increase the quality of a basic facility in their Bastion by one category, as shown on the table below.

| Space Increase    | Cost     | Time Required |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------------- |
| Basic to Fine     | 500 GP   | 2 turns       |
| Fine to Luxurious | 2,000 GP | 5 turns       |

### Basic Facilities (Comfort & Influence) - FIXME
Basic rooms improve life at the Bastion. When a basic facility is upgraded to its top quality (your table’s term, e.g., **Luxurious**), it enhances faction play:

| Basic Facility  | Modifier (when upgraded)                                                                                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bedroom**     | **Host a Guest.** When you take **Patronage** or **Enforcement**, gain **+1 Favour** with the target faction.       |
| **Dining Room** | **Private Supper.** **Meetings cost 4 Favours** (instead of 5).                                                     |
| **Parlor**      | **Grease Palms.** **Patronage** also **removes 1 Heat** with that faction.                                          |
| **Courtyard**   | **Public Face.** **Enforcement** generates **−1 Heat** (minimum 0).                                                 |
| **Kitchen**     | **Comfort Food.** **Cool-Off** removes **+1 extra Heat** (total −2).                                                |
| **Storage**     | **False Crates.** After **Enforcement**, you may **shift 1 Heat** from the hiring faction to a named rival instead. |
### Political Facilities
Political options modify only **Faction Actions** and resolve **this turn**. Examples include: granting a Meeting at **4 Favours** without using an action, reducing the cost of the next Pull by **1 Favour**, causing the next Enforcement to generate **−2 Heat**, granting **+1 Favour** on successful Enforcement, or ignoring the first social/permit debuff rolled against you this turn. See **Political Bastions** for the full list.

### Business Facilities 
Business options modify **Trade** and **Craft** only. Examples include: a **Social Hall** that allows **Patronage to two factions** at once (or three if expansive), or an **Artisan’s Wing** that provides multiple tool bays and advantage/time-reduction on eligible crafting steps. See **Business Bastions** and **Crafting** for specifics.

## Faction Events
*This section doesn't make any sense if you didn't read [[Faction Relations]].*
Before resolving player actions, we vibe check the city for this turn. The DM rolls **1d8** to check active factions for each city tier, then **1d10** to check that faction's approach.

| Roll | Active Faction                                                   | Flavor       |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1    | [[Cartocci]]                                                     | bureaucratic |
| 2    | [[Monarquia Braliana]]                                           | bureaucratic |
| 3    | [[Malvessi]]                                                     | physical     |
| 4    | [[Cinders]]                                                      | physical     |
| 5    | [[Luminari]]                                                     | social       |
| 6    | [[Il Velluto]]                                                   | social       |
| 7    | [[Zenonni]]                                                      | weird        |
| 8    | Multiple factions active - roll twice again and ignore other 8s. |              |
- **Cartocci & Crown (bureaucratic/diplomatic):** permits, audits, legal shields.
- **Malvessi & Cinders (physical/aggressive):** hits, stoppages, escorts.
- **Luminari & Il Velluto (social):** scandal, invitations, press.
- **Zenonni (weird):** anomalies, specialists, windfalls.

Great call. Here’s a tightened, DMG-style rewrite that bakes in your math, your nautical bands, and the flavor shifts you want: when a faction is **antagonistic** it’s easier to cool things with them; when a faction is **patronizing** you, they bristle if you court others.

---

# Faction Approaches (District Posture)

At the start of a Bastion Turn—**before** resolving actions—determine each **active** faction’s posture toward each character the first time that character’s plan touches that faction.

## Roll & Modify

Roll **1d10 + Standing − Heat − Wanted (+Favours)** for that **character × faction**:

- **Standing:** War −3, Hostile −2, Interfering −1, Neutral +0, Helpful +1, Friendly +2, Allied +3.
    
- **Heat:** subtract current **Heat** with that faction, then **set that Heat to 0** (it “burns off” for the week).
    
- **Wanted:** subtract current **Wanted** with that faction (Wanted **is not** reduced by this).
    
- **Favours (optional):** the character may **spend Favours** with that faction **now** to add +1 per Favour (spent whether or not the result improves).
    

Map the total to a **Faction Approach** and apply the **district economy** modifiers **for this turn**:

|Total|Faction Approach|District Economy (this turn)|
|:-:|---|---|
|**≤ 0**|**Sea Storm**|**Income −20%**, **Prices +20%**|
|**1–2**|**Gale Warning**|**Income −20%**, **Prices +20%**|
|**3–4**|**Headwinds**|**Income −10%**, **Prices +10%**|
|**5–6**|**Steady Waters**|**±0%**|
|**7–8**|**Favorable Winds**|**Income +10%**, **Prices −10%**|
|**9–10**|**Full Sail**|**Income +20%**, **Prices −20%**|
|**≥ 11**|**Fair Tide**|**Income +20%**, **Prices −20%**|

**Stacking.** If multiple factions are active, sum Income/Prices across bands, capping at **−30% / +30%**.  
**Different players, different bands.** Modifiers differ per character; two PCs may sit in different bands against the same faction.

---

## Approach Effects (this turn)
When a character resolves an action that **touches** the faction, apply **one** effect from the current band. Effects are written in two parts:

- **With this faction:** what happens if you court or de-escalate **them**.
- **If you court others:** what happens if, this turn, you do **Patronage or Enforcement** for **some other faction** while this one is active.

On **Gale Warning / Headwinds** (antagonistic), players get **easier de-escalation** with the active faction.  
On **Favorable Winds / Full Sail** (patronizing), players get **discounts** with the active faction but **pay a price** for courting others.

> Unless an effect says “no action,” it modifies the normal cost/effect of the action you’re already taking. If multiple touches occur with the same faction this turn, you may claim **one** effect from that band; further touches are **Steady Waters**.

---

### Sea Storm (≤ 0) — Attack!
- **Immediate:** Resolve a **Bastion Attack** (see “Bastion Attacks & Defenses,” below).
- **Also count as Gale Warning** for band effects after the attack resolves.

### Gale Warning (1–2) — disruptive posture
- **With this faction:**
    - **Cool-Off:** removes **+2 Heat** (total **−3**) with this faction.
    - **Meeting:** **4 Favours** (instead of 5) **or** **Meeting with advantage** (choose one).
    - **Pull:** **−1 Favour** (min 1) **or** **advantage** on the check (one Pull).
- **If you court others:** The **first** time you take **Patronage/Enforcement** for **another** faction this turn, mark **+1 Heat** with this faction.

### Headwinds (3–4) — pressuring posture
- **With this faction:**  
    - **Cool-Off:** removes **+1 Heat** (total **−2**) with this faction.
    - **Meeting:** **costs 5** as normal, **but** scheduling can’t be snubbed/blocked this turn.
    - **Pull:** check DCs **ignore Heat penalties** this turn.
- **If you court others:** If you take **Patronage** for another faction, mark **+1 Heat** with this faction **unless** you also took **Cool-Off** with them this turn.

### Steady Waters (5–6) — business as usual
- **With this faction:** No change.  
- **Courtesy:** if you took **Patronage** to this faction today, you may **remove 1 Heat** with them (free) once.
- **If you court others:** No extra Heat beyond the action’s normal effects.

### Favorable Winds (7–8) — mild patronage

- **With this faction:**
    - **Meeting:** **4 Favours** (no action), **or** **Meeting with advantage**.
    - **Pull:** **−1 Favour** (min 1) **or** **advantage** (one Pull).
    - **Enforcement (success):** **−1 Heat** with this faction.
- **If you court others:** The **first** **Patronage/Enforcement** you do for **another** faction this turn imposes **+1 Favour** cost **or** **+1 Heat** with this faction (player’s choice).

### Full Sail (9–10) — strong patronage

- **With this faction:**
    
    - **Meeting:** **4 Favours** (no action) **or** **Meeting with advantage**.
        
    - **Pull:** **−2 Favours** (min 1) **or** **auto-success** on a **Minor Pull**.
        
    - **Patronage:** **+1 extra Favour** and **remove 1 Heat** with this faction.
        
    - **Enforcement (success):** **−2 Heat** with this faction.
        
- **If you court others:** **Any** **Patronage/Enforcement** for **another** faction this turn inflicts **+1 Heat** with this faction **and** adds **+1 Favour** to that other action’s cost (if it has one).
    

### Fair Tide (≥ 11) — windfall

- **Free Pull:** Take **one Minor Pull now** from this faction **for free** (no Favours, no check). If a Minor Pull doesn’t fit, your **next Pull with this faction** today costs **−2 Favours** (min 1).
    
- **If you court others:** As **Favorable Winds** (the “+1 Favour or +1 Heat” surcharge on your first cross-courting action).

# Bastion Attacks & Defenses (Sea Storm Resolution)

Use this quick clash when a character’s **Sea Storm** result targets their bastion.

**Alignments (vectors):** **Physical**, **Social**, **Bureaucratic**.  
**Edge loop:** **Physical › Social › Bureaucratic › Physical** (wraps). Winner has **advantage**; loser **disadvantage**; same vector **no edge**.  
**Zenonni:** determine their vector randomly (d3) each time.

## Facility Defense (write this on rooms)

Each **Special Facility** lists an **Alignment** and a **Defense Die**:

- Default **Defense Die:** **1d6**.
    
- Fortifying sites may list **1d8** (e.g., **Barracks**, **War Room**).
    
- (Optional sizing: Cramped d4 / Roomy d6 / Vast d8.)
    

## Resolve the Strike

1. **Vectors & Target.** Attacker uses the faction’s alignment (Zenonni: roll d3). Defender chooses **one Special Facility** to front the defense; that facility’s alignment and **Defense Die** apply. If no relevant facility exists, defend at **1d4**.
    
2. **Roll.**
    
    - **Attack:** **1d6 + current Heat** with that faction (after Approach, Heat is 0; add any new Heat earned since). Apply edge (adv/Dis).
        
    - **Defense:** roll the facility’s **Defense Die**; apply edge (adv/Dis).
        
3. **Outcome.**
    
    - **Attack total > Defense total:** **Hit.** The bastion is **disabled for this Bastion Turn** (the character loses their **Bastion Action**; Faction Actions may still occur). **Repairs are free**, covered by whatever profit was left.
        
    - **Attack total ≤ Defense total:** **Held.** No disable; narrate the thwarted strike.
        
    - _(Harsher optional): on a win by **5+**, also mark the defending facility **Shuttered** (can’t take its Order) for this turn—repairs still free.)_
        

---

### Designer’s note

- **Low bands help you mend fences** (cheap Meetings, strong Cool-Off).
    
- **High bands bristle at two-timing** (surcharges or Heat when you court someone else).
    
- The **district breathes** (money dials), **Sea Storms bite** (lose time, not gold), and **Standing** still matters without extra tables.

---

## Quick GM Flow (with d10)
1. **Identify active factions** in the district.
2. As soon as a character’s plan touches an active faction, roll **1d10 + Standing** to set that faction’s **band for that character**.
3. **Apply economy modifiers** from all active bands to today’s Trade/Prices (respect caps).
4. **Resolve actions**, applying each faction’s **one** modifier when touched (or +1 Heat on negative bands).
5. Apply **Cross-Faction Attention** when players court outsiders.

---

### Why this is nice
- **Equal odds** across the middle, with true **crit low/high**.
- **Standing matters** without extra tables.
- **No hard locks**—costs and discounts keep choices live.
- **District breathes** via money dials.
- **Who gets Heat** is crystal clear.


## Tracking & Record-Keeping

For each **character × faction**, track:

- **Standing:** War (−3), Hostile (−2), Interfering (−1), Neutral (0), Helpful (+1), Friendly (+2), Allied (+3).
- **Favours (0–7)** and **Heat (0–7)**—they cancel **1:1** as they’re gained.
- **Wanted (0+)**—at **5 Heat**, reset Heat to 0 and mark **Wanted +1**, then resolve that faction’s **Hostile Move** (sabotage, shakedown, or hit).

> **Sheet Tip.** A single table with **players as rows** and **factions as columns** works well, recording **Standing** in the cell (e.g., `S-1`, `S0`). Annotate Favours/Heat/Wanted inline as `S0 3F 1M 0W` if desired.

---

## Design Notes & Intent
- **One dial per scene.** Actions are short, decisive, and this-turn. We avoid deferred effects where possible so the Bastion phase doesn’t spill into distant real time.
- **Separation of concerns.** Political content touches Favours/Heat/Meetings/Pulls; Business content touches Trade/Craft. This keeps choices clean.
- **Standing is the bias, not the engine.** Standing shifts odds on event tables, but advancement is gated by **Meetings** and **Wanted**, keeping narrative stakes front and center.

---

### Open TODOs
- **Finalize baseline Trade payout** and whether district context modifies it.
- **Confirm Basic-room upgrade ladder** (names, costs, timelines).
- **Lock the four faction event tables** after a few sessions of playtest tuning.
- **Define “political” vs “non-political” facility tags** for interactions (a short appendix list).
- **Add a one-sheet reference** (turn order, action list, Standing ladder, event summaries).
