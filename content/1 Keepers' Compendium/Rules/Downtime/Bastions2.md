# Summary

A **Bastion** is a character’s seat of influence in Bral—part home, part workshop, part political machine. During downtime, the campaign switches to **Bastion Turns** (about 7 days). In each turn, characters improve holdings, craft items, recruit crew, cultivate faction ties, and prepare for the next venture.

This section presents the shared framework your table uses whenever Bastions come into play. Specific political/business facilities, crafting, and faction procedures live in their own chapters.

## Running a Bastion Turn

A Bastion Turn represents roughly a week of focused effort, meetings, and maintenance.

_**Sequence of Play**_

1. **_Declare Participation_.** Each character who is present in Bral may take Bastion actions this turn.
2. **_Set Active Factions_.** Pick which factions are exerting themselves in each city tier this turn (e.g., Bragora, La Città). For each active faction, you’ll roll a single **Base Posture** (see _Faction Approaches_ below).
3. **_Players Choose Actions_.** Each participating character takes **one Business Action** (per Bastion; some facilities let you affect this) and **one Political Action**.
4. **_Resolve Faction Approaches_.** For each character whose plan touches an active faction, derive their **Personal Treatment** from that faction’s one Base Posture roll. Apply district economy modifiers, band effects, and any facility modifiers.
5. **_Resolve Actions_.** Apply facility modifiers, political abilities, and effects from faction approaches.
6. **_Update Records_.** Record Standing, Favours, gold gained/spent, project progress, and any facility changes.

> **DM Guidance.** Keep the tempo brisk. Ask each player for their plan up front, roll Base Postures once per active faction, then walk the table resolving outcomes in one pass.

## Actions

Bastion play uses two families of actions: **Business** (money and projects) and **Political** (relationships and pull). Unless a rule says otherwise, each character takes **one of each** per turn.

### Business Actions

- **Trade.** Your Bastion earns coin through rents, enterprises, and sales. Your table’s baseline might be **20 gp × character level** (or a facility’s alternate). Facilities often add flat gp or % modifiers for **this turn**.
- **Craft.** Start or advance a project (mundane or magical). See **Crafting** for time, assistants, tools, and Essence. Business facilities apply here (workshops, labs, yards, archives).
- **Recruit / Empower / Harvest, etc.** Facility‑specific business orders which can give other long-time bonuses.

### Political Actions
Political actions move **Favours** and **Standing** per **Faction Relations**.

- **Patronage (low profile).** Offer donations, service, or access to **one faction**. Gain **+1 Favour** with that faction.
- **Enforcement (high profile).** Visible work—protection, muscle, resources—for **one faction**. Gain **+2 Favours** with that faction. (The DM may also apply **−1 Favour** with a plausible rival.)
- **Cool‑Off.** Apologies, gifts, and PR to improve footing with **one faction**. Gain **+1 Favour** with that faction (reducing a negative by 1 if applicable).
- **Meeting.** Invite a faction emissary for a formal audience. **Cost: 3 Favours** with that faction. **Effect:** raise your **Standing by +1** (one step).
- **Cash‑In (Pulls).** Spend Favours for help. **Minor/Major/Greater = 1/2/3** Favours (see **Faction Relations** for examples and DCs).

> **Shortcuts & Swaps.** Political facilities/abilities may discount or compress these actions (e.g., hold **one Meeting without consuming your action**, or apply **−1 Favour** to your next Pull).

---

## Facilities
Facilities are the rooms, staff, and agreements that give a Bastion teeth. Mechanically they’re either **Business** (Trade & Craft) or **Political** (Patronage, Enforcement, Cool‑Off, Meeting, Cash‑In). You can skin a political ability as a room, hireling, or contract; the ability is what matters.

_**Acquiring & Upgrading Basic Facilities.**_ Use your table’s cost/time ladder. When a basic facility is upgraded to its top quality, it often grants a small, always‑on **political modifier** (e.g., Dining Room reduces Meeting cost by 1 Favour; Bedroom adds +1 Favour to Patronage/Enforcement once per turn, etc.). See the **Basic Facilities** page for the finalized list.

_**Special Facilities.**_ Workshops, Smithies, Labs, Arcane Studies, Docks, Archives, etc. provide **this‑turn** boosts to Trade/Craft (and, if tagged as political, may modify a single political action this turn). Each Special Facility lists an **Alignment** and **Defense Die** for Bastion Attacks (see below).

---

## Faction Events
This section references the standing/favours model. For details on Favours, Standing, Meetings, and Cash‑Ins, see **[[Faction Relations]]**.

### Active Factions (per tier)
For each city tier this turn, pick or roll an active faction:

|d8|Active Faction|Vector|Notes|
|:-:|---|---|---|
|1|Cartocci|Bureaucratic|Permits, audits, legal shields.|
|2|Monarquia Braliana|Bureaucratic|Royal writs, dispensation, guard presence.|
|3|Malvessi|Physical|Hits, stoppages, escorts.|
|4|Cinders|Physical|Strikes, sabotage, cell support.|
|5|Luminari|Social|Boycotts, lantern walks, street press.|
|6|Il Velluto|Social|Galas, snubs, society columns.|
|7|Zenonni|Weird|Anomalies, specialists, windfalls.|
|8|Two active—roll twice again; ignore further 8s.|—|—|

---

### Faction Approaches 
At the start of the turn—**before** resolving actions—set a **Base Posture** for each **active** faction. Then, as characters interact, derive **Personal Treatment** from that one roll.

#### Step 1 — Base Posture
The DM rolls **1d10** for each active faction **once**. Apply the **district economy** to everyone **this turn**:

|Base Roll|Band|District Economy (this turn)|
|:-:|---|---|
|**≤ 0**|**Sea Storm**|**Income −20%**, **Prices +20%**|
|**1–2**|**Gale Warning**|**Income −20%**, **Prices +20%**|
|**3–4**|**Headwinds**|**Income −10%**, **Prices +10%**|
|**5–6**|**Steady Waters**|**±0%**|
|**7–8**|**Favorable Winds**|**Income +10%**, **Prices −10%**|
|**9–10**|**Full Sail**|**Income +20%**, **Prices −20%**|
|**≥ 11**|**Fair Tide**|**Income +20%**, **Prices −20%**|

**Stacking:** Sum all active factions’ income/price modifiers, cap at **−30% / +30%**.

#### Step 2 — Personal Treatment (per character × faction)
Each faction's approach to a character depends on their approach but is modified by their standing:

**Personal Total = Base Roll + Standing + Favours\***
*Negative favours always apply and are consumed. Positive favours can add to the total if the player chooses when approaches are rolled.*

Map the Personal Total to the **same bands**. That band is the character’s **Personal Treatment** for action effects with that faction this turn.

- Different characters will often land on **different bands** from the **same** Base Posture.
- Per faction, per character, you may claim **one** boon/surcharge from your band this turn; further touches default to **Steady Waters**.

### Band Effects (this turn)

**Sea Storm (≤0)** — _Attack!_ Resolve a **Bastion Attack** against this character (see below), then treat further touches as **Gale Warning** for them.

**Gale Warning (1–2)** — _disruptive posture_
- With this faction: the first **Patronage/Enforcement** or **Cool‑Off** you do **with them** also grants **+1 Favour** (on top of normal gains). A **Meeting** can be taken with **advantage**.
- If you court others: the **first** **Patronage/Enforcement** you do for **another** faction this turn causes **−2 Favours** with this faction.

**Headwinds (3–4)** — _pressuring posture_

- With this faction: the first **Patronage** or **Cool‑Off** you do **with them** grants **+1 Favour**.
- If you court others: your **first** **Patronage** for someone else this turn causes **−1 Favour** here..

**Steady Waters (5–6)** — _business as usual_

- No extra effects. **Courtesy:** if you did **Patronage** to them, you may **+1 Favour** with them once (free).

**Favorable Winds (7–8)** — _mild patronage_

- With this faction: your first **Patronage/Enforcement** with them yields **+1 extra Favour**; you may hold **one Meeting without consuming your action** (still costs **3 Favours**).
- If you court others: your **first** **Patronage/Enforcement** for another faction costs **+1 Favour** **or** inflicts **−1 Favour** here (your choice).

**Full Sail (9–10)** — _strong patronage_

- With this faction: your first **Patronage/Enforcement** with them yields **+1 extra Favour**; your next **Pull** with them costs **−1 Favour** (min 0); a **Meeting** may be held **without consuming your action** and with **advantage** (still costs **3 Favours**).
- If you court others: **any** **Patronage/Enforcement** for another faction this turn inflicts **−1 Favour** here **and** adds **+1 Favour** to that other action’s cost.

**Fair Tide (≥11)** — _windfall_
In addition to Full Sail's effects:
- **Free Minor Cash‑In** now (no cost, no check), or your **next Cash‑In with this faction** today costs **−2 Favours** (min 0).

# Bastion Attacks & Defenses (Sea Storm)
When a character’s **Personal Treatment** is **Sea Storm** (≤0), resolve a quick clash.

**Vectors (Alignments):** **Physical**, **Social**, **Bureaucratic**. Edge loop: **Physical › Social › Bureaucratic › Physical** (winner has **advantage**, loser **disadvantage**). **Zenonni** choose randomly (d3).

**Facility Defense.** Each Special Facility lists an **Alignment** and a **Defense Die** (default **1d6**; fortifying sites like **Barracks/War Room** may list **1d8**; optional size steps Cramped d4 / Roomy d6 / Vast d8).

**Resolve:**

1. **Vectors & Target.** Attacker uses faction alignment; defender chooses one Special Facility to front the defense (or defend at **1d4** if none fits).
2. **Roll.** Attacker **1d6 + current negative Favours** (use the absolute value of the defender’s **negative** Favours with that faction; if their Favours ≥ 0, add 0). Apply edge (adv/dis). Defender rolls the facility’s **Defense Die** (edge applies).
3. **Outcome.** **Attack > Defense** → **Hit:** the Bastion is **disabled for this Bastion Turn** (lose the **Business Action**; repairs are free). Otherwise, **Held**.

---

## Quick GM Flow (with d10)

1. **Active factions.** Pick per tier.
2. **Base Posture.** Roll **1d10** once per active faction; apply economy modifiers (respect caps).
3. **Plans.** Players declare actions.
4. **Personal Treatment.** When a plan touches a faction, compute the character’s band from Base Posture using **Standing** and **Favours** (and any Favours they spend now).
5. **Resolve.** Apply one band effect per faction per character; then default further touches to **Steady Waters**.
6. **Attacks.** If any Personal Treatment is **Sea Storm**, run a Bastion Attack.
7. **Record.** Update Standing, Favours, income, projects.

## Design Notes

- **Two dials only.** Standing and Favours do all the work—no extra clocks.
- **This‑turn effects.** No delayed penalties; the Bastion phase stays snappy.
- **District breathes.** Money dials (income/prices) reflect street weather, while bands shape political friction.
- **Player choice.** You decide when to climb (Meetings at **3 Favours**); debts drag you down automatically.
