# Overview: Major Factions
Each character tracks their relationship with each faction using three measures:

- **Standing.** A tiered attitude from a faction toward the character.
- **Favours (0–7).** Spendable goodwill from that faction.
- **Heat (0–7).** Recent ill-will with that faction.

When **Heat** reaches 5 with a faction, that character gains **Wanted** 1 with that faction (see Wanted, below) and Heat resets to 0. Favours and Heat cancel on a **1:1** basis as they’re gained.

## Major Factions
[[La Mano Legata]]
- [[Cartocci]]
- [[Zenonni]]
- [[Malvessi]]
- [[Il Velluto]]
- [[Luminari]]
[[Cinders]]
[[Monarquia Braliana]]

These are the major players in the Bralian politics. All of them will have Standing, Favours and Heat with each player character. You can interact with them using the Bastion system (as well as during the story), and they will trigger their own actions in Bastion Turns, which can help or hinder your operations.

# Standing Tiers
Standing represents a faction’s long-term attitude. Tiers are ordered from worst to best.

- **War (−3 Standing).** Will go out of their way to hurt you even if it’s not in their best interest to do so. 
- **Hostile (−2 Standing).** Will look for opportunities to hurt you as long as it doesn’t create serious problems for them. Expect same from you, and take precautions against you.
- **Interfering (−1 Standing).** Will look for opportunities to cause you trouble (or profit from your misfortune) if it causes no problems or significant cost to them. Expect same from you.
- **Neutral (0 Standing).**
- **Helpful (+1 Standing).** Will help if it causes no problems or significant cost for them. Expect the same.
- **Friendly (+2 Standing).** Will help if it doesn’t create serious problems for them. Expect same from you.
- **Allied (+3 Standing).** Will help even if it’s not in their best interest do so. Expect same from you.

> **Starting Standing.** Unless noted, all characters begin at **Interfering** with all factions. Except for the **Zenonni** - Vashet pulled a few strings to get them to **Neutral**.

## Changing Standing (Meetings & Wanted)
Characters change Standing by holding **Meetings** (see Meetings, below) or by accruing **Wanted**, as shown on the ladder.

| Standing    | Level | Meetings to go Up | Wanted to go Down |
| ----------- | :---: | :---------------: | :---------------: |
| War         |  −3   |         3         |         —         |
| Hostile     |  −2   |         2         |         3         |
| Interfering |  −1   |         1         |         2         |
| Neutral     |   0   |         1         |         1         |
| Helpful     |  +1   |         2         |         1         |
| Friendly    |  +2   |         3         |         2         |
| Allied      |  +3   |         —         |         3         |

> A Meeting that would raise Standing when the character already has **Wanted** with that faction first reduces **Wanted** by 1 (no Standing increase), then any extra Meetings may advance Standing.


# Favours
**Favours** are short-term IOUs held by a character with a specific faction.
- **Capacity.** A character can hold up to **7 Favours** with a faction. Excess Favours are lost.
- **Spending Favours (Pulls).** Characters spend Favours to request aid (“Pulls”) from a faction.
    - **Minor Pull (1–2 Favours).** A permit, an introduction, safe passage, lookout detail, or simple paperwork.
    - **Major Pull (3–4 Favours).** A small squad for one operation, access to restricted goods or places, forged documents that endure scrutiny, or quashing a minor charge.
    - **Big Ask (5–7 Favours).** A ship berth sealed for a night, erasing a case, a cutter and crew for one job, or shutting down a rival’s operation for a short time.
- **Pull Checks.** When uncertainty exists, call for a check at **DC 10 (Minor), 15 (Major), 20 (Big)** using an appropriate skill. Each **additional Favour** spent on the same Pull grants **+2** to the check.

> **Baliza monetária**: a minha idéia é que uma ação de downtime pra conseguir favours valha um *pouco* mais que uma ação básica de Trade num Bastion ([[Bastions#Trade (mod.)]]). O quão melhor é modificado pelo Standing: quanto mais longe de neutro, maior o valor - inclusive negativamente; só que em vez de lucro, são custos. 
> Ou seja: um Minor Pull neutro deve valer mais ou menos uns 20GP por nível de personagem, igual uma ação de [[Bastions#Trade (mod.)|Trade]]. Calculando um Big Ask com um aliado: 5-7 favours são umas 3-4 ações, então começamos de uns 70GP; chutando uns +50% pela aliança, isso valeria lá pelos 100-110 GP por nível. 

# Heat & Wanted
**Heat** is fresh trouble with a faction; **Wanted** is formalized hostility.
- **Heat Gain.** Unless otherwise stated, actions that anger or implicate a character with a faction add **1d4 Heat** with that faction.
- **Cap and Conversion.** On reaching **5 Heat**, set Heat to 0 and the character gains **Wanted +1** with that faction.
- **Heat vs Favours.** When a character gains Favours and Heat with the same faction at the same time, reduce one by the other **1:1**, then apply any remainder.
- **Effects.** For each **3 Heat** a character has with a faction, that character’s checks to secure Pulls from that faction suffer **+2 DC**.

### Wanted
**Wanted** reflects warrants, vendettas, or kill orders with a faction.
- **Gaining Wanted.** Each time Heat converts, the character marks **Wanted +1** with that faction and immediately triggers a **Hostile Move** (below).
- **Clearing Wanted.** Each Meeting with that faction first reduces **Wanted by 1** (no Standing change). A character may also clear **Wanted 1** by completing a special mission for that faction or by “laying low” (skipping their next Bastion Turn).
- **Hostile Moves.** When a character gains Wanted, the DM chooses or rolls a consequence:
    - **Sabotage.** A Bastion room is disabled until repaired (cost or downtime).
    - **Shakedown.** Pay a fine or gain **+2 Heat** with a different faction.
    - **Hit.** An encounter targets the character or their Bastion this week.

# Earning Favours & Heat
*More on this on the [[Bastions]] rules.*
Most faction-touching activities award **1d4 Favours** with one faction and **1d4 Heat** with one or more other factions (DM’s call), modified by approach.
- **Patronage (Low Profile).** Donate goods, coin, intel, or services. Gain **1–2 Favours** (1d4 −1, minimum 1) with the target faction; gain **0–1 Heat** (DM’s call).
- **Enforcement** **(High Profile).** Do rough work on the faction’s behalf. Gain **2–4 Favours** (1d4 +1) with the target faction; gain **1–4 Heat** (1d4) with one or more logical rivals.
- **Cool-Off.** Spend time and resources to reduce friction. Reduce **Heat with one faction by 1d3**; pay **100 gp per Heat** reduced or burn **1 Favour** from any other faction to cover costs.

> **Faction Drift.** When a character gains Favours with a faction, the DM may apply **+1 Heat** to one rival faction (or split between two) to reflect tension.

# Meetings (Advancing Standing)
A **Meeting** is a formal audience with a faction’s decision-maker to alter long-term relations.

- **Cost.** **5 Favours** from that faction.
- **Time.** One character’s Bastion Turn.
- **Effect.** Apply the Meeting toward Standing advancement per the **Standing Tiers** ladder.
- **Checks.** No check is required unless the fiction is uncertain; if a check is called for, use **Persuasion** at **DC 15** (advantage if held at a location **tagged** to that faction; see Tags, below).
- **Wanted First.** If the character has **Wanted** with that faction, the Meeting removes **1 Wanted** instead (no Standing change). Additional Meetings in later Turns can then raise Standing.

# Tags (Bastion Synergy)
A Bastion may have up to **two Tags** linking it to districts or factions (earned by upgrades or story).
- **Patronage at a Tagged site:** +1 Favour with that faction.
- **Meeting at a Tagged site:** Advantage on related checks.
- **Enforcement launched from a Tagged site:** On success, reduce Heat with that faction by 1 (minimum 0).

Soffiera Workshop — Tags: **Cinders**, **Zenonni**.

# Using the Module
1. **Record per character, per faction:** Standing tier, Favours (0–7), Heat (0–7), Wanted (0–3).
2. **At the end of each  Bastion action:** Award Favours/Heat; cancel 1:1; check for Heat→Wanted.
3. **At the Bastion Turn:** Each character chooses one interaction. Resolve Meetings toward the ladder.
4. **Apply Drift:** When a character gains Favours with one faction, consider adding Heat with a rival.
5. **Trigger Hostile Moves** on Wanted gain; repair, pay, or fight as needed.

# Quick Reference (Player-Facing)
- **Favours cap 7.** Extra are lost. Spend 1–2 Minor, 3–4 Major, 5–7 Big. Extra Favours on the same ask = **+2** per Favour.
- **Heat cap 5.** On 5: reset to 0; gain **Wanted +1** and suffer a Hostile Move. **+2 DC** on asks per **3 Heat**.
- **Meetings cost 5 Favours.** Use Meetings to climb the **Interfering → Neutral → Helpful → Friendly → Allied** ladder (counts vary by tier).
- **Wanted drops Standing** per the ladder and must be cleared before Standing can rise again.

# Minor Factions
Minor factions are not very relevant in the Bralian political landscape, aren't tracked with Standing, etc. and don't do anything on Bastion Turns. 

Some examples of Minor Factions are:
- Specific noble families (say Lord Gamalon, a powerful wizard with a magic curiosities shop);
- Dignitaries or commonfolk of racial quarters (such as the Dracon Embassy or the Dwarven Guilds); 
- Minor gangs (such as the Yakuza); 
- Powerful individuals (say you're great friends with [[Luigi Zenonni]], but don't necessarily have a good standing with the entire crew)

However, it's possible to **Ally** them during special interactions in the story or if you really, really want to go out of your way to do it; they'll give a minor specific boon to your Bastion. You can only be allied to one minor faction at a time, though.
