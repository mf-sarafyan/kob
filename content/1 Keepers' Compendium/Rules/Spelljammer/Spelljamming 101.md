# Introduction to Spelljamming 

Spelljamming is how mortals turn hulls and hope into passage through the wide‐bright beyond. A **helm** binds a pilot’s will to a ship; sails catch not wind but **aether**; and crews ride **astral currents** that lace the void between worlds. In our campaign’s cosmology, the 5e **Astral Sea** is the great ocean. The classic **Phlogiston** is one vivid, volatile _region_ within it—one of many—and **currents** are real lanes you can chart, defend, blockade, and lose.

The Rock of Bral sits on these crossroads—a Venetian bastion clinging to an asteroid, where honest captains and colorful criminals haggle over maps of flows as if they were gold.

## Cosmology: Wildspace, the Astral Sea, and Currents

**Wildspace** is the “egg white” around each Material world—the local void where planets, moons, and beasts like kindori drift. Enclosing each system is a liminal boundary (“crystal sphere” to some scholars), a tension in reality you can pass with the right heading and will.

Beyond that membrane stretches the **Astral Sea**, the conceptual ocean of thought and timelessness. Within it lie **regions** and **currents** (our campaign’s twist): enormous, thematically distinct tracts and rivers of astral flow. The **Phlogiston**—a prismatic, hyperflammable _region_—is one such tract; the **Numicrowyr (Crimson Cataracts)** and **Nyxefell (Veil Spectral)** are others. Each shapes navigation, politics, and danger.

### Rules (long form)

- **Crossing the Boundary (Wildspace → Astral):** Leaving a world’s system requires a plotted route to the local boundary (usually days at jamming speed; see Speeds below). Crossing requires a **Helmsman** at a helm and a **Navigator** with charts or references.
    
    - **Route Check (Daily):** The Helmsman makes an **Intelligence (Navigator’s tools or relevant proficiency)** check each travel day against a DC set by the route (DC 10 easy lanes, 15 standard, 18–20 for tricky/uncharted or storm-ridden paths). A Navigator can **Help** with their own check; success grants **advantage** to the Helmsman’s check that day (or +2 if you prefer flat modifiers). Failure wastes a travel day and may trigger a **Travel Event** (minor hazard, drift, encounter).
        
- **Currents & Regions:** Each current/region lists tags that alter travel:
    
    - **Speed:** ×1.5 to ×3 jamming speed on a “running with the flow”; ×½ against it.
    - **Navigation:** –2 to +5 to daily route DCs; some currents _force_ straight-line headings between defined waypoints.
    - **Hazards:** check **1/day** or on failure: **DC 15** save (type varies) to avoid effects like firestorms (Phlogiston), necrotic fogs (Nyxefell), mind squalls (generic astral storm).
    - **Mapability:** some currents drift seasonally; charts can become **stale** (impose +2 DC) until updated.

> _Designer’s note:_ This folds your “currents as real lanes” into play: they’re fast when known, dangerous when not, and absolutely political.

## Gravity & the Gravity Plane

Massive objects project a directional gravity. On ships, that resolves into a **gravity plane**—an invisible sheet bisecting the hull. Above and below decks share “down” toward the hull; cross the plane (falling over a rail, tumbling through rigging) and your down flips.

### Rules (long form)

- **Attraction:** Unattached objects within **100 ft** of a ship slowly drift toward its gravity plane at ~**10 ft/round** (DM can adjust by size).
    
- **Oscillation:** A creature that falls off the rail and crosses the plane oscillates across it, stopping roughly **at the plane** after **1d4 rounds** unless pushed, caught, or the ship accelerates away.
    
- **Competing Planes:** Between two nearby ships (within **2× their beam**), the stronger mass wins; otherwise objects hang neutrally between planes until a force nudges them.
    
- **Zero-G Manoeuvres:** A creature pushed free of all planes becomes **weightless**, moving in straight lines until acted on. Standing orders: clip in.

## Air Envelopes & Endurance

Ships and other great bodies carry their own **air envelope**—a bubble of breathable air equal roughly to the extent of their gravity field. Air quality degrades with use.

### Rules (long form)

- **Capacity:** A ship’s envelope supports **fresh air** for **120 creature-days** per 10-ton keel (adjust to your ship-size scale).
    
- **Stages:**
    
    - **Fresh:** No penalties.
        
    - **Foul:** After capacity is exceeded, all creatures aboard suffer **disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls** and **–10 ft** to walking speed. Each day, creatures make a Constitution saving throw of DC 10 + 1 per subsequent day without fresh air. On a failure, a creature suffers one level of [[Exhaustion]]. 
        
    - **Deadly:** After **fresh + foul** is exceeded (another equal block), creatures gain **1 level of exhaustion per minute** until air is refreshed or they exit the envelope.
        
- **Equalization:** When envelopes overlap (ships grappled, docking, skimming a planet), air quality averages instantly. Skimming a **planetary atmosphere** for **1 minute** fully refreshes to Fresh.
    
- **Contaminants:** Smoke, spores, and gas haunt envelopes; a **Boatswain** can vent overboard with rigging checks (see Boatswain actions).

## Helms & Helmsmen

A **spelljamming helm** is a conduit; attune and sit, and the ship becomes your body. You feel the strain of timbers, the belly of the sails, and the prickle of hazards in the current. The bond is potent—and tiring.

### Rules (long form)

- **Attunement & Control:** While attuned and seated, you are the **Helmsman**. You use your **spellcasting ability modifier** with proficiency for checks related to piloting the ship. 
- **Action Economy:** Piloting is **concentration-like**: you can cast and act normally, but the DM may call for a **Concentration check** when the ship takes a **critical effect** (see below) or you take damage.
- **Fatigue:** Helming for more than **8 hours** in a 24-hour period risks **exhaustion** as per forced march. Short breaks (1 hour off-helm) reset the count for that hour only.
- **Vacant Helm:** If no Helmsman is seated, **Speed becomes 0** and the ship cannot change facing except by drift or external forces.

## Ships at a Glance

Spelljammers are characters with stat lines. Typical stats:

- **Armor Class (AC):** How hard the ship is to hit.
    
- **Hull Points (HP):** Structural health on a ship scale; each 1 HP represents a _lot_ of creature-scale damage. At **0 HP**, the ship is **dead-in-space** (Speed 0; disadvantage to resist grapples; cannot jamming-charge).
    
- **Bulwark Points (BP):** An ablative buffer—reinforced plating, bracing, arcane wards—that soaks damage before HP.
    
- **Speed:** Tactical distance per round and **Maneuverability** (maximum turning angle you can sustain while keeping trim).
    
- **Hardpoints & Arcs:** Weapon mounts with defined **90° firing arcs** (fore, aft, port, starboard); turrets may have wider arcs at higher cost.
    

### Rules (long form)

- **Damage Order:** Damage reduces **BP first**, then **HP**. BP resets/refreshes through **Boatswain** actions (below) and repairs.
    
- **Crew Effects:** Falling below **minimum crew** imposes **–10 ft Speed** and **–45° Maneuverability** (or the closest step) and may prevent operating certain hardpoints.
    
- **Modules:** Sails, keels, helms, magazines, and other modules can be **disabled** on criticals or called shots (see Fighters & Called Shots).

## Speeds of the Void

Spelljammers live at three tempos.

### Tactical Speed (Combat & Close Quartering)

Measured turns, careful facing, and violent choices.

- **Movement:** On the Helmsman’s turn, move up to **Speed** and rotate up to your **Maneuverability** per move segment; weapons fire by **arc**.
    
- **Terrain:** Air envelopes, debris fields, and gravity gradients can limit movement or impose checks.
    
- **Dropping to Tactical:** Any hostile action, near-body navigation (e.g., in atmospheres, docks), or helm disruption drops you to Tactical immediately.
    

### Jamming Speed (Deep-Space Travel)

The long, straight burn between worlds.

- **Charge:** After **1 minute** of uninterrupted helm channeling, the ship enters **Jamming** and travels at **~100 million miles/day** in a **straight line**.
    
- **Gravity Wells:** You can’t start (or maintain) Jamming while deep inside another mega-object’s gravity field (e.g., low orbit or below). Exiting to a safe distance is required.
    
- **Currents:** Apply **region/current** modifiers (speed multipliers, DC adjustments, hazards).
    
- **Dropping Out:** You may drop to Tactical as a **free interaction** at the start of any round, or are forced out by critical helm shocks, grapples, strong wells, or losing the Helmsman.
    

### Planetary Speed (Atmosphere & Ascent)

The climb from sky to void and back again.

- **Handling:** Atmospheric flight adds **Weather** checks (Helmsman **Dex (Vehicles/Air)** or **Wis (Survival)**) and caps turning by sail condition.
    
- **Refresh:** Skimming an atmosphere for **1 minute** fully refreshes the **air envelope**.

## Crews, Bridge Roles, and What They Do

A ship is a community with jobs to match. In battle, characters take **bridge roles**; one role per creature (some roles unique, some repeatable). You can swap roles as a **bonus action** if the current occupant agrees.

### Captain (unique)

Rallies and commands—calling grapples, boarding actions, and desperate gambles.

- **Orders (1/round):** As a **bonus action**, grant one ally at a station **+1d4** to a ship-scale check or attack this round (range: on board).
    
- **Grapple/Boarding (see below):** You initiate these actions, setting DCs and sequencing the assault.
    
- **Steady the Line (1/short rest):** End **Frightened** on crew or **remove Shaken** critical effect from the ship.
    

### Helmsman (unique)

Keeps the keel true; their checks/saves often stand in for the ship’s.

- **Evasive Handling:** As a **reaction** when the ship is targeted by a ship-scale attack, make **Dex save**; on success the attack is at **disadvantage**. Uses equal to **proficiency bonus** per long rest.
    
- **Power to Sails:** As an **action**, trade **–10 ft Speed** for **+45° Maneuverability** (or vice-versa) until start of your next turn.
    

### Boatswain (unique)

Wring performance from wood and rope; patch damage; brace a side to take a hit.

- **Bulwark Regeneration:** At the **start** of the Boatswain’s turn, the ship regains **BP equal to half its maximum BP (rounded up)**.
    
- **Brace (Action):** Pick one **90° facing**; until the start of your next turn, ship gains **resistance** to the first instance of damage from that arc.
    
- **Fix It Up (Action):** Make a **DC 15 Intelligence (Carpenter’s tools)** check to clear a **Disabled Module** (critical result) or to restore **1d4 BP** if nothing’s disabled.
    
- **Work the Sails (Action):** Until your next turn, exchange **+20 ft Speed** for **–45° Maneuverability** _or_ **–20 ft Speed** for **+45° Maneuverability** (choose one).
    
- **“Hurry It Up!” (1/minute):** Rally the crew to **fully restore BP** and allow **one Gunner** to fire a **bonus-action** attack this round.
    

### Gunner (repeatable)

Makes the ship bite—choosing targets and firing arcs, timing the broadside.

- **Open Fire (Action):** Operate one hardpoint in your arc; apply your class features that affect ranged weapon attacks if appropriate.
    
- **Suppressive Fire:** On a hit without dealing HP (BP soaked), can impose **–10 ft Speed** _or_ **–45° Maneuverability** on the target until the end of its next turn (choose one).
    

### Fighter Helmsman (repeatable)

Launches in cutters and skiffs to harry weapons, slash rigging, and force mistakes.

- **Deploy (Action):** Launch a fighter; while deployed, you act on the **fighter’s** turn order and can make **called shots** (below).
    
- **Emergency Repair:** Spend your action adjacent to an ally ship’s crippled module to allow its **Boatswain** to reroll **Fix It Up** this round.
    

---

## Grapples, Boarding, and Called Shots

**Grapples** end standoffs; **boarding** ends arguments. Fighters and crack crews also make **called shots** to disable parts.

### Rules (long form)

- **Grapple (Captain Action):** Target a ship within **30 ft** in any arc; make an **Opposed** check (your **Str (Athletics)** or **Dex (Vehicles/Space)** vs. theirs). On a success, ships are **grappled**:
    
    - Both ships’ **Speed is halved**; they move together.
        
    - **Helmsmen** on either ship can **contest** the grapple each round as an **action**.
        
    - A ship at **0 HP** automatically fails to resist grapples.
        
- **Boarding (Captain Action):** While grappled or within **10 ft**, you may **order a boarding party**. Resolve with creature-scale combat; while boarding is active, each ship’s **Gunners** fire at **disadvantage** at the meleeed target to avoid friendly fire.
    
- **Called Shots (Fighter/Fine Fire):** You may target **Weapons, Sails, or Modules** at **disadvantage** using the ship’s AC. Each has **10 Hull Points** (ship-scale); at **0**, it’s **Disabled** (weapons can’t fire; sails lose **45° Maneuverability** each; helm shock forces a **Concentration** check from the Helmsman). Damage must pass **BP** to affect parts. **Fix It Up** can clear **Disabled**.

## Critical Effects

When a ship suffers a **critical hit** (or on certain hazards), roll on a **Critical Effects** table to generate story-rich consequences: **Fire in the Rigging**, **Casualties**, **Module Damaged**, **Holed Hull**, **Ship Shaken**, **Spelljammer Shock** (Helm feedback—Helmsman must save or lose the helm for a round), and so on. Fires spread if not contained; **Boatswain** actions and crew checks can triage.

### Rules (long form)

- **Trigger:** Natural 20 with ship weapons, certain hazards, or by fiat at dramatic moments.
    
- **Effect Resolution:** Each effect lists: immediate consequence, checks to mitigate (usually **DC 15** tools or **Dex/Con** saves), and ongoing penalties until repaired or doused.
    
- **Stacking:** Multiple concurrent effects impose cumulative **–10 ft Speed** and **–45° Maneuverability** caps at DM discretion.

## Using Currents in Play (Examples)

- **Phlogiston (Rainbow Flow) – Region:**
    
    - **Speed:** ×2 jamming speed with the flow; ×½ against.
        
    - **Hazard:** **DC 15 Con save** on failure/each day; on fail, **Firestorm** scorches sails (lose **45° Maneuverability**) and **1d4 BP**; open flame explodes (don’t).
        
    - **Mapability:** Drifts seasonally (old charts impose +2 DC).
        
- **Numicrowyr (Crimson Cataracts) – Current:**
    
    - **Effect:** Pushes you outward from its center; checks at **DC 15 Str (Helm)** each day to hold line; failure throws you **1d4 hexes** off route and triggers a **Warfare Encounter**.
        
- **Nyxefell (Veil Spectral) – Region:**
    
    - **Effect:** Perception checks suffer **–5**; each day make **DC 15 Wis save** or suffer **1 level of short-term Madness** (10 minutes) from whispering fogs; necrotic squalls deal **1d4 BP** on failed **Con save**.
        

> Tweak numbers to your table’s taste; the important thing is that **currents feel different** and matter to navigation, logistics, and politics.

### Final Notes for Your Table

- Keep **House Rules** clearly tagged in your notes so players know what’s core and what’s custom.
    
- Use **currents** to create chokepoints, seasonal routes, and _reasons_ to care about Bral’s cartographers, lighthouse-mages, and smugglers.
    
- Let **Boatswains** be heroes. In ship fights, their turn is the “heartbeat” that keeps everyone alive.
    
- When in doubt, **favor storyful criticals** over raw HP races: a fire in the rigging or a disabled helm is more memorable than “–7 HP.”
