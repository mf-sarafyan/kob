While you have the Exhaustion condition, you experience the following effects:

- **Exhaustion Levels**. This condition is cumulative. Each time you receive it, you gain 1 Exhaustion level. You die if your Exhaustion level is 6.
- **D20 Tests Affected**. When you make a D20 Test, the roll is reduced by 2 times your Exhaustion level.
- **Speed Reduced**. Your Speed is reduced by a number of feet equal to 5 times your Exhaustion level.
- **Removing Exhaustion Levels**. Finishing a Long Rest removes 1 of your Exhaustion levels. When your Exhaustion level reaches 0, the condition ends.
